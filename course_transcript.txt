I taught a room full of business professionals nan for just six hours at a company hackathon. By the end of that
0:07
day, they built a fully automated driver's license validation system that's now running in production for
0:12
their underwriting decisions. No coding experience required. That's the power of
0:17
any end when you actually know what you are doing. Hey, I'm Ryan, a full-time data scientist at a payments company.
0:24
And over the last year, I've created over 70 plus videos on workflow automations as well as AI. I help
0:30
businesses and freelancers save hundreds of hours every month. Whether you're a business owner drowning in repetitive
0:36
tasks, a freelancer looking to scale your services, or someone who just wants to build out powerful automations
0:41
without writing code. This course is designed to take you from a complete beginner to building productionready AI
0:47
workflows in any end. Here's what makes this course completely different. Most any end tutorials will show you one
0:53
workflow and call it a day. This course contains over 15 hours of content broken
0:58
into 30 strategically designed sections that build up on top of each other.
1:03
You'll start with the basic fundamentals and progressively tackle more complex real world scenarios. I work with
1:10
clients every single month building automation solutions across healthcare, real estate, finance, and more. And
1:16
every workflow that you see in this course is going to be based off of actual client work, not theoretical
1:21
examples. So what are you going to learn in this course? Well, you're going to learn the N fundamentals that 90% of
1:26
users get wrong. You're going to learn how to connect to any API from the Google Suite to custom HTTP requests.
1:33
You're going to learn advanced pageination techniques that most courses don't even mention. We're going to be building out AI agents that actually
1:39
work in production. We're going to cover the basics of rag, which is retrieval augmented generation. essentially
1:45
feeding your own internal data into AI agents. And I'm going to show you how to turn these skills into income. Every
1:52
single workflow and template is available for free in our school community so you can download, customize, and deploy. This is the
1:59
course I wish existed when I started with any. So, make sure to bookmark this video because you're going to come back
2:05
to this multiple times for specific sections. And please do not watch all of this in one day. Save some time and
2:11
spread it across at least a week or two. Anyways, good luck with this course and I'll see you in lecture number one
2:18
shortly. All right, so our first part of the course is going to break down the differences between cloud and self-hosted. You'll often hear people
2:24
saying, "Oh, I'm using self-hosted nan or I'm using cloud." And you might be a little bit confused. So, let me simplify
2:31
that for you. If you are signed up on the website nan.io and have a subscription plan of some
2:38
sort, chances are you're going to be on cloud. pricing is going to be based
2:43
around executions. And I'm going to show you this in a minute. Uh, nan.io does offer a few self-hosted uh,
2:50
subscriptions, but 95% of the stuff that you can purchase on there is going to be specifically for cloud. If you host any
2:58
end on your own infrastructure, so this could be anything from a computer, this could be a VPS or a cloud server, this
3:05
is going to be considered self-hosting. And there's a misconception out there that hey, self-hosting is always
3:11
cheaper. And that's just incorrect as some businesses want to self-host on their own servers. There's people that
3:18
are going to have to manage that specifically. And also on the self-hosting side of things, you're
3:23
going to have to sometimes get a business license if you have a larger company. And these licenses can start at
3:29
$10,000 a month and get more expensive. So, while self-hosting may be a little
3:34
bit cheaper if you're a solo entrepreneur or you have a very small team, it can get pricey uh really
3:41
quickly, especially if you are going to be running on your own servers. I quickly also wanted to talk about the
3:46
differences between both of these. I'm going to put up a table on the screen right now so that way we can do the
3:52
comparison. So, first let's talk about the cost. Self-hosted is free to get
3:58
started and is usually cheaper initially. Uh cloud is obviously more expensive out of the gate. You're going
4:03
to be spending at least $20 a month for a cloud license. However, there is a 14-day free trial. Now, on the setup
4:11
side of things, self-hosted, you manage everything. So, you manage if your stuff
4:16
is down, you have to manage all these updates and there's a lot of work associated with it. Which is why when I
4:21
say on the business side of things, businesses will have to employ a specific person that helps focus on that
4:27
as part of their day-to-day routine. However, on the cloud side of things, this is all managed by NAN and there's a
4:33
99% uptime. On the control side of things, with self-hosted, you have full
4:38
control and you have a lot more options and capabilities. Whereas cloud, you're going to be a little bit more limited.
4:44
Maintenance, again, with self-hosted, you have to handle all the different updates. You're going to be in charge of
4:50
maintenance, whereas cloud, yes, you do have to make some updates, but they're honestly like two clicks away, and it's
4:56
super fast. data for self-hosted. This stays on your server. However, on the
5:01
cloud side of things, this is going to be stored on the NAN server. Let's talk about community nodes. So, community
5:06
nodes are different nodes that companies will create on the self-hosted version.
5:12
All of them are going to be available for you on cloud. They're limited. The N team has to go through the node and also
5:18
approve it. So, there's a little bit of a lag between when a company pushes out a community node and when it's available
5:24
on any end cloud. One other drawback is the MCP connections. With the self-hosted side of things, you have a
5:30
lot more advanced options due to community nodes and different things like that. Whereas on cloud, it is
5:35
limited. However, I do believe that this is going to be changing in 2026. All right, so who are these best for? Well,
5:42
if you're going to go the self-hosted routes, this is better for power users or people that just want to get started
5:48
in Nan for free. cloud. It's much better for people who want a quick start and
5:53
then really focus on convenience. I don't know the exact data point, but I would assume a lot more people are going
5:58
to be on cloud versus self-hosted. So, I'm going to be building out this course
6:03
based around any cloud. However, everything that's going to be taught in cloud should be applicable into
6:10
self-hosted minus showing you really quick how to update your specific instance. So, let's jump into part one,
6:17
which takes a look at any cloud. All right. So, I'm on the N cloud website
6:22
and you'll see it like this. Um, they've had this site for a while. So, I do see it changing here in the future. So, if
6:28
it does change a little bit, um, I apologize. It's nothing I can control about that. So, if you want to see your
6:34
pricing, you just go into the pricing options over here. And you can see that there's two different ways to price. You
6:40
have monthly or you could go annual. So, I am personally paying for this starter over here at $24 a month. However, if
6:47
you go to annual, it is $20. So over here, you'll see what is included. So
6:53
starter is hosted by N. So you have cloud hosting over there. And what you
6:58
have next is pro hosted by N. But then you go into the business side of things. This is self-hosted, which I again I
7:05
mentioned like there is some things on nan.io that are self-hosted. And then if
7:10
you go to enterprise, it's either hosted by nan or self-hosted. um business as I
7:15
mentioned is $10,000 because you can see $800 per month built annually. If not, you're going to $960
7:22
per month. So, most of us aren't going to need business right away. What I started with is starter, and I still
7:28
have this on my specific plan. There are some limitations with this as well, and
7:34
you'll see this through the course. I talk about some of the limitations associated with it, but you also start
7:39
with 2500 workflow executions, which is pretty nice. this will get you really, really far. And honestly, unless you
7:46
have a ton that you're already trying to automate, I think this is going to be the route that you specifically start
7:52
with. So, I would start with your free trial, which I believe the trial is 14 days. Once you have this going and let's
7:58
say you're need more executions, then you could upgrade into Pro. So, with
8:03
Pro, you have multiple shared projects. You can have 20 concurrent executions at a specific time. You have 7 days of
8:09
insight. You have workflow builder credits, which we'll show you a little bit later. This is a really cool way to
8:15
save some time. You have more admirals. You only have one admin over here. You have multiple here. Variables, workflow
8:21
history, and execution search. A lot more available on that side of things. And you can also change the amount of
8:27
executions. So over here, you're stuck at 2500. However, on the pro side, you can go up to 50k executions and you're
8:34
paying 144 a month. You could also use a custom plan. Um, but you have to I believe you have to mention or talk to
8:40
the team on that side of things. Again, I'm on starter. So, until you really start getting over that 2500 threshold,
8:47
you don't have to worry about pro business. As you can see over here, there's a lot of different plans associated with it. Like, if you're 500k
8:53
executions, you're spending almost $6,300 a month. And enterprise is even more expensive than that. Um, so just to
9:01
keep that in mind. I believe they also have an other plans too. So you can see startup plan under 20 employees, check
9:07
if you qualify for a startup plan and get 50% off business. So on the business
9:12
side, if you have under 20 employees, you could be paying $480 a month, which is a better deal. There's also the
9:19
community edition. So self-hosted version is available on GitHub. So if you're going self-hosted, that's what
9:24
you're going to be specifically using. Here's even more breakdown of what features are available in each plan. So
9:31
you can see max days on the workflow history is one, pro is five, enterprise is 365.
9:36
I do wish this 365 number went down into pro and maybe the starter was five. I do
9:42
find this to be quite limited on the workflow history which is a little bit unfortunate. I think this is very
9:47
generous for the workflow credits 50 and also 1,00. You can see a lot of these
9:53
developer tools are available except for global variables. So unfortunately I will not be teaching you guys global variables and nan because I don't have a
10:00
pro account. Maybe one day when I do you can see different environments stuff like that not available in either
10:06
starter or pro. These are just enterprise available only. So again something I just can't show you guys
10:11
because I'm not going to be showing out,000 $2,000 a month on any end. My YouTube channel doesn't even bring in
10:16
close to that even in ad revenue. Um going into the workflow executions you have max active workflows. All of these
10:23
are going to be unlimited across the board. You have automatic retries, max saved execution. So you can see some of
10:29
the other different data points if you specifically require about it. Execution logging uh AI assistant only available
10:35
upon requests. Uh other information over here. And by the way, if you do go with
10:41
like the business or enterprise route, there are other features I believe that are not under uh this page. So like
10:47
SLAs's and things like that. So you'll have to reach out to the N team, I believe. Um, you can see filtering date
10:52
range. There's a lot more other things. Maybe the support, you can see, yeah, email support, dedicated support with
10:58
SLAs. So, to get the really more granular insight, you're going to have to contact them, go through their sales rep for enterprise. Um, you can see pay
11:04
by invoice, sales assisted. So, there's a lot of other questions, Q&A on there,
11:09
but all you're going to have to do is click on one of these plans. I would really recommend you go starter. You can
11:16
start with the free trial. And I believe the free trial, like I said, is 14 days. So get going with that and uh yeah that
11:23
is going to be cloud. The other two are going to be uh using docker to get started and then we also have an option
11:30
to specifically use self-hosted with a VPS provider and I'm going to show you how to use both of these here in a
11:37
second. I already have videos on the channel just walking through the process of these. So I'm just going to play
11:42
those right now. These are going to be essentially the only videos that I reuse for my main channel. Everything else is
11:47
going to be original content throughout this course. However, since self-hosted on hosting here does cost money, I don't
11:53
want to repeat that process and there is a few steps in there. And then Docker, it just takes a little bit of time to
11:59
download everything and get it going for the first time. So, we'll just repeat those. I'll put them on the screen right
12:05
now. And make sure to choose your own path. Again, my personal opinion is if
12:10
you want to get started the fastest, you go with any cloud over here. If you want to have more control over yourself but a
12:17
little bit more maintenance, I would go with self-hosted on Hostinger. If you're going to go self-hosted Docker, it is free, but there's going to be
12:24
limitations. So, let's take a look at those right now. We'll start with self-hosted Docker. All right, guys.
12:29
Let's get started. So, what we're going to do first is download Docker. So, you can do this by searching Google and look
12:37
for Docker download and you'll get put to this get started Docker page. I'll put the link also down below in the
12:43
description. Then you have these two icons over here. Learn how to install Docker or download Docker Desktop. Now,
12:51
um, what we're going to be doing is clicking download Docker Desktop is I'll be showing you how to do that. Now, there's a few different options, right?
12:57
You have Apple computers, you have Windows, as well as Linux down there. Now, personally, I have Windows, so I'll
13:03
be showing you how to set that up specifically. And one caveat is that you need to have Windows 10 or newer. So you
13:11
have an older version of Windows, you know, this is not going to work for you. So make sure you have Windows 10 on that
13:16
side of things. I'm going to be choosing AMD 64. So once you click that, you're
13:21
going to get a download on your computer. It might take you a minute or
13:27
so uh to have that fully downloaded, but uh I'm going to pause the video right here until that is downloaded, and we'll
13:34
be right back once it's ready to go.
13:39
All right. So, double click on the Docker icon if it's downloaded to your desktop or wherever it's downloaded if
13:44
it's in folders, whatnot, and then it'll open up a popup.
13:52
Inside this popup is the service agreement. Now, obviously, I'm not going to tell you if you're breaking the terms
13:58
of service or not. You can view full terms if you want. Um, but it mentions, you know, if you have overturn 50
14:04
employees or more than $10 million in annual revenue, you have to have a pro subscription, right?
14:10
So, you're learning this, testing it out. You should be okay on that side of things. So, if you agree, click accept.
14:19
And then you get this screen over here. Welcome to Docker. Now, you can set up an account if you would like to, right?
14:26
Whether you want to use work or personal or you can even skip this screen, right?
14:31
So, I'm not going to set up account here. I'm just going to skip and we're going to go right into it. Now, what I
14:37
get over here is it says WSL needs updating. So, what we're going to do is go into the command line and update this
14:44
really quick. It's actually going to be quite easy. I know for some people the command line can seem scary, but all we
14:50
have to do is just copy this over here. And we'll do that here shortly.
14:58
All right. So, what I'm going to do is just copy this. So, click copy on that side of things.
15:04
And then we're going to go to our command line. So, cmd on that side of things. And look up your command prompt.
15:10
What I'm going to do is paste in that update.
15:17
And then you can see it starts updating on this side of things. And I'll go through on that side and get
15:24
everything ready for us. So I'll skip ahead when this is ready to go.
15:30
All right. So update is now complete. So that's the only thing we're going to need for our command prompt here in uh
15:39
this install. So feel free to close that out and then it's going to restart on
15:44
this side of things. So just click restart. You're going to get this icon over here
15:50
and then we're going to be good to go here pretty soon. So this is a pretty fast restart.
15:57
but I will skip it to when it's ready. All right. So, this should be your
16:02
Docker page now. Um, if you didn't have to do the update like I did, you'll
16:08
probably get put right into here. But now, what we need to do is go onto the
16:14
images tab over here to the left. You can find it right under containers. So,
16:19
go to images. And then what we're going to do is we're going to search images to run. And this is where we can find NE.
16:27
So click on that and then inside over here we're going to search NAN and it's going to be your top result
16:33
most likely. Right? So 100 in 100 million downloads on that side of things. So the first thing we're going
16:39
to do is pull the latest version of that. Right? And see there's a lot of reviews on that too. So just click pull.
16:46
And then you'll see again this loading icon over here. It'll take a little bit to get this ready. And I'm going to skip
16:53
to when it's done. All right. So, it's going to stop here in a second. And perfect. We have that
17:01
working. So, you can see status downloaded new image. It's the latest version. And
17:06
we're almost ready to get this going. Okay. So, the next thing what we're going to
17:12
want to do on this side of things is click on run. And then you're going to
17:17
see optional settings. So, we're going to want to fill out our host port. Now,
17:23
by default, it says 5678. So, that's what I did on this side of
17:29
things, but from looking online, some people do have issues with 5678. So,
17:36
feel free to change that. Or one that I saw that people used was 5680.
17:41
And then it's going to say, do you want to allow public and private networks to access this app? Click allow on this
17:47
side of things. And then you can close out. And then what you'll see is we have this going over here. And then at the
17:53
very bottom it says localhost 5678. So click on that over here and then you get
18:00
this page over here which is set up an owner account. Now if you already have credentials elsewhere um this is not
18:07
going to work right. This is the credentials for your local version. So just set up computer first name, last
18:12
name, email and then also a password. And then if you want to receive updates or not click that check box.
18:20
And then what you want to do is click next. Now some people are going to get a 524 error, but uh nothing will happen on
18:27
that side of things. You still should be good to go. Then you get this survey over here. Fill it out. Right? So I'm
18:34
just going to click on I'm not using any N for work just so I don't have to fill it out. And I'm going to put over YouTube on this side of things. And then
18:41
get started. And then what I would recommend is you already set this up. So it says get paid
18:47
features for free. It'll send you a key to your email. Now, personally, like I'm not going to be using this version after
18:54
this tutorial, but if you do want to use it, right, uh, put in your email over there. It will send you a key. And then
19:01
you want to sign up for on that side of things. Again, it's free, but I'm just going to skip because I don't really
19:08
need it for this tutorial. So, what you can do is now start building. And what I'd recommend is just make sure to test
19:15
one basic workflow to see if this is working properly. So, I'm just going to create a workflow.
19:21
All right. So, click the plus icon in the top right. We're going to do a manual trigger. Um, so just go up here
19:26
to the top. Trigger manually on that side of things. Yep. So, we have
19:32
that over here, right? And then we're just going to go and add a few other nodes. So, what we're going
19:38
to do now is do an edit set node. And inside over here, we're going to
19:44
double click in there. We're just going to map a manual field. We're going to go over here and set an array. And then
19:50
we're just going to essentially put a few different pieces of automation software in over here.
19:57
And then what I'm going to put over here and then inside the array I'm going to
20:03
put in nan. I'm going to put in make and then I'm also going to put in zap year.
20:09
Right? Probably the three most common ones right now. Then you can see that is working over here on the output side of
20:16
things. And then after that, what we're going to do is go over here and do a data
20:22
transformation. And we're going to use a split out node. We're just going to drag and drop this over here, which is going
20:28
to split out our array. Right? Very, very basic on this side of things, but
20:33
just want to make sure that these nodes are working and it looks good to go on that side of things. And again, right,
20:40
you're going to have issues if you set up a web hook in over here. So, you can mock that data up. Um, but if you want
20:46
to get web hooks working, that is a whole different process on that side of things, right? Um, and outside the scope
20:53
of this particular video. Lastly, I want to show you how to start and stop this. So, just load up Docker Desktop again,
21:00
right? And by default, if you refresh it, right, nothing's going to happen. You're fine
21:06
over there. So, let's go to our Docker Desktop on the side of things, right? So, click that icon and we're going to
21:12
click stop, right? So then you can see it says stopping any n
21:17
and we can go back to any n and then we refresh this and now it's not going to work and it says this site cannot be
21:24
reached local host refused to connect we have issues over there. So then just click this start icon over here and then
21:31
um it's going to restart it. So you'll see that happen here in a second and you can see we have all this information
21:36
populating once again and just click on the URL
21:42
and take a look. We have our workflow that we started building out right over here and we are good to go. Using any
21:50
end cloud it's going to cost you over $20 every single month. But what if I told you that you can self-host N for
21:57
just about $5 opportunity to save well over $100 a year. Not only are you going
22:03
to be able to save this money, but you can also unlock a larger selection of community nodes and get even more
22:09
control over your workflows. Now, I know what you're thinking, right? Self-hosting? This sounds pretty complicated, but don't worry. In this
22:15
video, I'll be taking you step by step throughout the entire process. So, at the very end, you'll have nan running on
22:20
your own server. Also, big shout out to Hostinger. They reached out and were able to give me free hosting for this
22:26
full walkthrough. And for viewers of this channel, they're offering an extra 10% off any of their subscriptions with
22:32
code data science. Show you exactly where you can apply that discount code in throughout this video as we build
22:37
this setup. So your different plans below over here. Uh KVM1, which is $4.99
22:43
a month. KVM2, which is $6.99 a month, $9.99 for KVM4. Then KVM8 is $19.99.
22:49
They have different specs for every plan, right? 4 GB of RAM 8632
22:55
and you know feel free to choose which one that you would like to start. Now also if you use my code right you're
23:01
going to get additional 10% off over here. So you're technically not paying the screen price you're actually paying
23:07
10% less. And to be full fully transparent right like most things with hosting online the renewal rate is going
23:13
to be a little bit different. And you can see over here it says renews at $10 a month for two years right cancel
23:19
anytime. So there is going to be that information, right? And I can tell you
23:25
like I own a few different websites out there. Usually, you know, the get in price is going to be a little cheaper
23:31
and then they increase it over time. That's just how it is anywhere that you go. So let's say you want to start this
23:37
off, right? And let's say choose plan for KVM1. So then you choose plan over here and it goes into your cart. We're
23:45
going to walk through this here in a second with you guys. Okay. So you can see you can choose your
23:52
period. So again you can choose 24 months, right? You can go here to 12
23:58
months, right? It's going to be a little bit more expensive. If you choose one month, a little bit more expensive. I wouldn't
24:04
recommend that you just do a one month. Like look at 12 or 24 months. Even at 12 months, right, you're at 5.99. Um but
24:11
lock in that rate at 24. Now also to show you where you want to put in your coupon code. If you go over here, right,
24:17
put in data science. So data science, you click apply over here.
24:27
You'll see saved you a little bit of money, right? So you saved actually 12 bucks if you're doing the cheapest plan.
24:33
So highly recommend you choose that code if you want. Uh regardless, right? Next thing you want to do is choose your
24:38
server location. So choose the server that's closest to you, right? Um you can see United States over here. If you're
24:45
in Europe, choose that side of things. South America or Asia, right? I'm obviously in the states, so I would want to choose that. And then also just make
24:52
sure that you click Nan on the side of things, right? There's two N's. Just click the one that is here by default,
24:59
right, with the thumbs up. Okay. Then what you're going to do is go over here and click continue. All right. Then
25:05
you're going to jump into this screen, right? So you can do Google, you can do GitHub, or sign this. Let me just do a Google one for example.
25:12
Continue. And then you're going to get to this screen with your billing address and stuff like that. So, I've already
25:18
have my account, so I'm not going to go through this, but just fill out your information, right? Address, city,
25:24
state, zip code, and then your payment details down below. Just make sure data science is over here to save you a
25:29
little bit of money, and then you're going to be good to go. So, once you have that, we'll move on to the next
25:35
step, and I'll show you where that goes. All right. So now we have our H panel
25:42
within Hostinger. And what we're going to want to do is it says your KVM2 setup
25:47
isn't finished yet. Set up your service to start using it. So we're going to go over here and click setup. Okay. So
25:53
first we're going to do is set up a server location. Now you want to choose the location closest to you. So I'm
26:00
going to go into North America over here. Yep. Click next. Okay. And then on this
26:08
side of things, what it's going to ask you for is choose an operating system. So I'm just going to go over here and type in nan. I'm just going to go over
26:15
this over here. So build 2404. Okay. And
26:20
select that. And then it's going to say choose a root password. You'll use the root password to log into your VPS. So
26:28
make sure to choose a password over here. And make sure it fits all these criteria. One number, one lowercase, 12
26:34
to 50 characters, etc. Right. You can also set up an SSH key. Probably outside
26:40
the scope a little bit on this video. Okay. Save the password over here. They have a malware scanner for free. So, you
26:46
might as well just select that. And then it says setting up your VPS. This will take about 5 minutes. Feel free to leave
26:52
this page. You'll get an email once your VPS is ready to go. So, we're going to do I'm going to save this recording real
26:59
quick and I will be back when this is ready to go. All right. So, we're in now. Let's go over here to manage VPS.
27:07
Sweet. And then we get this little survey. I'm just going to say personal reason on here. I'm going to say AI and
27:14
machine learning. Save that. Awesome. And then you can see all of our information here on this side of things.
27:21
And I'm just going to click over here to manage app. And then what you'll see is it says setup owner account. So what
27:27
we're going to do is set this up all over again on this side of things, right?
27:33
And what I'm going to do on this side is grab my email. So, and Nolan data. Okay.
27:38
So, now we're going to want to do is set up our owner account. So, again, set up email, first name, last name, and a
27:44
password. I want to receive security and product updates. I'm going to click next over here. And it says customize N for
27:52
you, right? Best describe your company. I don't know. We'll just click over
27:57
here. I'm going say YouTube. Yeah, it doesn't really matter too much. Data
28:03
science. There we go. Myself, less than 20 people.
28:10
How do I find out? Let's say YouTube also. Okay. And it says get paid features for free forever. So, receive a
28:18
free activation key for more advanced features below. Lifetime access, right? Workflow history, advanced debugging,
28:23
execution, tagging, folders. Sure, we'll send that over here. Why not? and take a
28:30
look. We are now officially in Nan. So, this is really awesome, right?
28:36
So, it says your license key is on the way. We have that over here and we should be good to go. All right. So, and
28:42
to activate this, all I did is get this email over here. It says please find your license key to unlock select paid
28:48
features. Right, click activated over here. And it says you have 14 days to activate it. Just activate it right now.
28:55
And there's a little notification over here that's been activated. So awesome. And it says you're on the community
29:00
edition registered and we are good to go. So just go back over here and let's
29:05
create our first workflow. All right. And then we get taken into this screen over here. So we're going to keep this
29:12
super simple for the video. What I'm going to do over here is click first step. I'm just going to do a chat
29:18
trigger. We can say chat trigger over here. Okay. And then what we're going to do next is set up an AI agent. So, we'll
29:26
say AI agent over here. Awesome. And then this is just going to be based off
29:31
of the chat input. Now, we're going to have to set up our credentials. I'll show you really quick how we could do that. Uh chat model, right? This is
29:38
where we're going to be setting up our credentials at. So, I'm going to say open AI. And you'll see that says select
29:44
credentials. So, we're going to have to create credentials. And I have a few videos here on the channel talking about how to create credentials and such. I'm
29:49
just going to create a new credential. It's super easy to get your credential on OpenAI. So just go to OpenAI like
29:55
this, right? Log in. Then once we're in, we're just going to go over and get an API key. So we're just go over here,
30:02
settings, API keys, create new key,
30:08
test, nan cloud, set a project,
30:14
and you can also set permissions like how much you want to spend your on your G. I'm just going to go over here and do
30:19
that. So save that over here.
30:25
Sweet. And it's been saved. Okay, great. Okay, great. And then just to stay up to
30:32
date, our model is not GPT41. We actually want to set this up into GPT5.
30:39
So make sure we save that over here. And also, what I want to do really quick is just say memory. I'm going to do a
30:45
simple memory, right? We'll say context 5. So, we just want to open up our chat
30:51
and just make sure this works. So, I'm going to click open up chat and I'm going to say, what is the alltime strikeout leader?
31:01
And this should be pitcher-wise should be Nolan Ryan. Super easy question. You
31:07
can see our workflow is running over here. And Nolan Ryan with 5,714 career
31:14
strikeouts MLB. Sweet. So that is working on that side of things. So I
31:19
also want to show you really quick a few other things. Number one, I want to show you community nodes as well as um how
31:26
you can update this because there are going to be updates and this is a little bit different than when you work on any
31:31
end cloud. All right. So I I closed out over here and what I'm going to do to update is we're going to go over here to
31:37
browse terminal. You'll see this over here. Now, what I'd recommend is just click clear so that
31:45
you have all this space now. And you're just going to follow these commands. And there's actually article on the website.
31:50
Super super easy. So, all we're going to do is pull the latest version with Docker. So, we're going to go over here
31:56
and say docker compose pull. So, go over here and say docker space compose space
32:03
pull. Okay. Then we're going to say docker
32:09
space compose down. And then lastly, what we're going to do
32:15
once this is running, go to two.
32:23
Okay. Lastly, we're going to say docker compose up dash d. Right. Three lines
32:31
like that. I'll probably put in the description. But yeah, that's essentially it. Now you have all this
32:38
updated on N and you can close this out, right? Let's close that out. And I'm
32:43
here back in my terminal. All right. So now let me show you how to work with community nodes. So click these three
32:49
dots over here and then go into settings. And then what we're going to go and go
32:55
over here and say community nodes. So it says supercharge your workflows with community nodes. Install node packages
33:01
contributed by your community. install a community node. So, find community nodes to add on the npm public registry. So,
33:08
let's look on this side of things. So, here you can see there's over 1,000 different community nodes that you could
33:15
work with on this side of things. Now, I know Tavi is really, really popular. So,
33:20
maybe we'll do a video like that here on the channel, but you can just keep going over here
33:26
and see. Now, I know also MCP is really popular as well. So maybe we want to go on that side of things. We'll use this
33:33
one. So then what we're going to do is just copy this name over here. So it says copy to clipboard over here. And
33:39
then I'm just going to paste in the package name over here. I understand the risk of installing unverified code from
33:44
public sources. So then just going to click install.
33:49
And then you can see I have this community node. Now another way to install it, let me just show you that
33:54
and go into this workflow. And one of the community nodes that has been out now is Appify. And you can see it's over
34:01
here. And we want to just click install node. So two different ways on that side of things.
34:08
And uh yeah, now you says package installed. And now we have amplify in here, right? And let's say I wanted to
34:14
set up something with ampify, right? I just go over here to ampify. You can see we have all these different
34:20
actor actions. And I've already covered this here in the channel. So make sure um to check that out. One thing's nice
34:26
is this run task and get data set. when amplify community node was available in
34:31
cloud it did not have that but now it does so it's super super nice but yeah that is essentially it with community
34:37
nodes really quick before we jump into lecture too I quickly wanted to share with you guys where you can find all of
34:43
the resources for this course for free that includes JSON files that includes notes for each lecture as well as a
34:50
community so if you have any questions you could ask them and help you out with those uh I'm super active in here and I
34:56
try to help out as many people as possible Again, this is all for free. You can join our school group. Let me
35:01
show you this really quick. So, here is our school group. I'm recording this on
35:06
New Year's. So, just made a post on that. We also have Hangouts as the group. So, I've been a little bit busy
35:13
this week and last week recording this course, but you can see like whenever we have a hangout, we'll post it in over
35:18
here. And uh a nice little shout out on that side of things. So to get all the
35:24
resources for this course, and by the way, they'll all be added in over here once I finish the course. I just put a
35:29
few over here for demo purposes. What we're going to do is go over to this NV2 course. So click on that and then you'll
35:37
see we're going to have a start here section which will the video talk about the best way to approach the course and
35:43
then each of these lectures and there's going to be probably well over 30 lectures all compiled together in the
35:49
course. So for example, I just put this together really quickly. Lecture three c four concepts just a note every nan
35:55
workflow is built with the same fundamental pieces understanding triggers nodes and data flow unlock everything else in this course and then
36:01
uh just some notes like trigger starts a workflow nodes are the components of a workflow how to pin data modify and pin
36:07
data like these are just my notes for the course and I'll throw these in over here and I'll expand this over time as
36:13
well if people are enjoying this and have other feedback associated with it in addition we have our resources down
36:19
here so you can just click on this and this is our JSON file. So every lecture, well, I'd say probably 95% of the
36:25
lectures are going to have a JSON file. Some things won't. For example, lecture one where we just talk about the
36:30
different types of NAN. So if I go over here and download this, you'll see we have section three core concepts. Let me
36:36
show you really quick how we could upload this into NAN. So all you need to do is go over here and create a
36:43
workflow. And we're going to go and click these three dots on the side of things. And I know you don't know the
36:49
whole user interface. We're going to talk about that in lecture two. Um, but all you're going to do is click import
36:54
from file and then go to your downloads. So, let me find our downloads on here.
37:00
So, this is our downloads and it says section 3 core concepts. So, you click on this and this is the exact workflows
37:06
that I used when I was teaching lecture 3. So, as soon as I finished recording, all I did is I saved this workflow and
37:13
then I essentially had this ready to go to publish in the course. So, we'll talk
37:18
about edit fields. We'll talk about an AI agent. Well, this over here would build your first workflow, which was
37:25
kind of one of the homework assignments directly in the video. And then I showed you how to do this as well. So, all of
37:30
my notes as I was going through live and teaching are in over here. And in
37:35
addition, in the future, uh, each of these sections will have a bonus homework section that is not available
37:41
in this video. So, um, if you want to have extra credit and really learn the
37:46
concepts, there's going to be a bonus in here. Uh, just also quickly show you there is other additions in our
37:52
classroom section. So, we have discounts and links for some of the different things that we reference here in the video. We also have an N road map if you
38:00
want to learn different concepts over time. And we have a lot of the N workflows and JSON files from our other YouTube videos. This is still being
38:07
built out. So, um, by the time that you're watching this, it might be a little bit fuller. And then we have
38:12
member created workflows. So, if people want to submit a workflow on here, uh, they can. And we'll give a shout out to
38:18
that specific member. So, all this is available in our school community. It is 100% free to join. It's not $100 a
38:24
month, $200 a month. This is our free group. Giving as much value back to you guys as possible, and I'd love to have
38:30
you be part of it. Join our calls. uh post over here and uh learn to grow your
38:35
skill set whether it's an N data or AI. A lot of us are just trying to improve our skills and upskill in life. Anyways,
38:43
back into this course. I know we have a long way to go. I just really quickly wanted to share with you how you could
38:48
access everything. So, don't don't worry too much about keeping very particular notes on each section. Don't about
38:55
having to replicate everything because it's all available for you in this free group. All right. See you.
39:02
Okay, so hopefully that you have either cloud or self-hosted right now. No excuses. There's some free options,
39:09
trial options, and paid options. What I want to do now is kind of walk you through where everything lives in any.
39:16
Now, I'm going to be using cloud. So, if you do have self-hosted, there's going to be some slight variations, but
39:22
probably about 95% of what I show you over here is going to be applicable. So,
39:27
I find it really helpful understanding where everything lives within a piece of software before I really dive into it
39:34
just because if I have an error or need to find something, I typically spend a lot of time trying to find it. So, I
39:39
want to clear up any confusion with that. Next lecture, we're going to actually start jumping into some of the triggers and nodes and build your first
39:46
workflow. But with that out of the way, let's take a look at this. Now, when you log in, you're typically going to go
39:51
into this screen right over here. We probably don't have any workflows as of yet unless you've really started with
39:57
the program. So, let me show you a few of the different sides. First thing what we have is all of our flows and these
40:04
are essentially the automations that you are creating. What's great is you can see if it is a personal workflow over
40:11
here and then you can see if you've shared it with anyone else and you can see that there's a plus one. Up next
40:16
over here you have this icon right here. So all these negative signs means it is not published and I should have some
40:23
green check marks and these means that they are published in general. You can
40:28
also sort this. So you have sort by last updated, sort by last created, sort by name, uh a toz or za. You can also add
40:37
in some additional filter criterias if you want to. Uh so you can filter by tags, by status, which is published or
40:44
unpublished, archived workflows as well as the particular owner and go over here
40:49
and search as well. And you can see the name of the workflow, when it was last updated, and when it was officially
40:56
created. In addition, what you have over here are different tabs. So you'll be using workflows the most. Uh the second
41:03
one that you'll use quite a bit is going to be credentials. And what credentials is are your login to different services.
41:10
So you can see I have my Google Drive credentials over here with OOTH. I have HubSpot which is OOTH. Uh I have
41:16
anthropic over here. I have my Gmail account. I have some header offs that I have over here. I have Cloudflare. So
41:22
different options over here. You can see if it's a personal one or if it's someone on your particular team. Next is
41:28
going to be your executions. So this tells you if there uh execution was successful or not. And you can see we
41:35
have our specific workflow. And this is going to be a probably a little bit out of scope right now and you're going to
41:40
be confused about it. But we're going to cover this a little bit later on in the course. So if you have an error of some
41:46
capacity, it's going to populate over here. If everything worked in particular, you'll see this green check
41:51
mark. You can see when the workflow specifically is started, how long it took for that specific workflow, and
41:58
then also the execution ID. Next, we have variables. I don't have this on my plan and we're not going to be covering
42:04
this in the course today, but I may make a another video in the future on this is
42:11
only available for pro and I'm not going to pay for that. Lastly, we have data
42:16
tables and we are going to be covering data tables. I want to say it's somewhere from like lecture 8 to 10
42:21
somewhere around in that particular area and it's going to be very helpful. You can think of data tables like a Google
42:27
sheet but it's native directly into NEN. And why this is amazing is you don't
42:33
have to worry about API calls. So you don't need to worry about sending data to Google Sheets. You don't have to worry about sending data to Air Table.
42:39
And uh this is a really great way just to store internal data. You pull data,
42:44
do some testing. We'll cover this in a lot of detail, probably 20 to 30 minutes alone a little bit later on in this
42:51
course, but that is going to be one of the tabs that you could click over. In addition, what you have over here is
42:56
your executions. Uh you have how many failed executions. Obviously, this is my kind of testing account for YouTube, the
43:03
failure rate, the time saved associated with it, uh, which is calculations, and maybe we'll cover that as well in the
43:09
course, and also the run time on average. So, I'm going to just jump back into workflows. I'm going to show you a
43:16
few other settings here before we move on. You can also change the number of workflows you show per page. So, by
43:21
default, it is 50, but you can change this to 10, 25, or 100. You have also multiple pages on that side of things.
43:28
If you go to the top right, you have a few different options as well. So you can create a workflow which is going to
43:33
be the automations that we're going to be covering. You can create a credential which is going to be your login to a
43:38
particular website like API. And then we also have our create the data table. And
43:44
I just find it very helpful. I'm always over here just creating workflow. And you can see that we're in the workflow
43:49
tab. It says create workflow. We're in the credential tab. It creates credential. Then we go to data tab. It goes to create data table. So, it's not
43:57
always going to say create workflow. And I do like that component because the NAND team made it really nice. Like if I'm going to data tables and I don't
44:03
want to just click down and find data table. Like it's already right over here. And I just think that was a really great design. Okay. So now what we have
44:12
is a lot of different settings over here to the right. Microphone's actually a little bit in the way. So might move a
44:17
little bit out of screen over here just to see them. But the first one is to expand the sidebar. So maybe out of the
44:23
gate you have a sidebar that looks like this. Personally, I just hide it for these YouTube videos to give you guys a
44:28
little bit more space. But you'll see we have overview, personal, shared with you, chat, admin panel, templates,
44:36
insights, help, as well as settings. So, everything I've showed you so far is on
44:41
our overview side of things. What I want to show you next is personal. So, this is just what you personally have. And
44:48
you can see this has changed slightly. So, this has workflows, credentials, executions, and data tables. You can see
44:54
variables is not available on that personal section. So that is gone as well as this particular header. And you
45:02
know maybe in the future I see the any end team kind of merging these together. I don't know for sure but you have that
45:09
very very similar. Next what you have is shared with you. So any workflows that someone shared. Uh so this was one for a
45:16
particular YouTube video uh my editor was helping me with. We haven't even published a filter node video as of yet.
45:22
This was shared over here. Next, what we have is our chat hub. And we're going to talk about this entirely in a lecture
45:29
within this course. And this is relatively new like within the last two weeks or so. But I really like chatub
45:35
because essentially what chat hub is is this is your internal essentially chat GPT for nan. And the best part about
45:42
chatub is you can actually talk directly into your workflows which is great. In
45:49
addition, what you can do is build out personal agents. So you can have an agent for a particular task and then you
45:56
can see the workflow agents. So this is a personal agent. I have one that's built out just for SQL debugging. And
46:03
then we have workflow agents over here. And why these are helpful is you can use these to talk to your particular
46:10
workflows if you have a chat trigger. And a lot of this might not make sense right now, but later on the course you
46:16
will uh use it and you're going to be like, man, this is a awesome feature. But again, think of this as like chat
46:22
GPT. You can just ask questions. You can do whatever you want. And what's great about this as well is you can go over
46:28
here and you can choose whatever model you want as long as you've set up the particular credential. So you can see
46:33
GPT uh all these over here. If we go to anthropic, all that. So instead of having like one tab open for anthropic,
46:40
one tab open for chat GPT, you can do everything all over here in addition to working with your workflows and asking
46:47
questions. Again, very very nice. And just to show you what this looks like as well. So, I just have some older stuff
46:54
over here. And you can see these were examples just talking to workflows,
47:00
which is why these are workflow agents. This over here was just another question. I'm asking GBT5 Mini and I was
47:07
also asking about the personal agent a little bit earlier and then I was testing uh building out a UGC creator
47:14
over here. One limitation and I do think the any end team will eventually solve this is this does not work right now
47:21
with images or videos. In fact any end team does know about that because a few of our creators talked to them about
47:27
that in a call. So you know in the future I can see this being changed but again I just wanted to show you what is
47:34
available in chatub as of now and you can see it is in beta version. All right so you just click into any logo and
47:40
we're going to be back over here to the homepage. So that's overview, that's personal, shared with you. Now you have
47:46
a lot of other sections which is our admin panel, templates, insights, help as well as settings. So let's go into
47:52
our admin panel first. And we'll click this. And here you see this option. It
47:58
says N. You have your dashboard manage. You have your help setter. You have your open your instance. It tells you that
48:04
the instance is currently online. that tells you what version of Nan that you are currently running which is important
48:10
because what ends up happening is Nan team drops a ton of new features literally weekly and it's super
48:17
important that you stay up to date on that side of things if you want to access new features. So you might be going like, "Oh, how do I actually the
48:24
N?" And let me show you. So you click over here into this gear icon and you can see it says N version and I'm on the
48:31
latest stable version, but you'll find that they often have a better release as well as a stable version. So just go
48:36
over here and choose whatever one you personally want. Since I'm making a lot of videos on YouTube, I use this for
48:42
better releases just so that way I have the newest nodes and newest settings available. But uh if you want to just go
48:49
stable, you have that option as well. You have your time zone over here, executions to save. You have community
48:57
nodes, which we're going to talk a lot more about. Know a little bit about community nodes uh within the previous
49:02
lecture, but uh community nodes are pretty important. Obviously, they are limited on cloud versus self-hosted, but
49:09
if you want to access community nodes, you have to go over here. You want to disable them as well, you can choose uh
49:15
to to that option. Again, it really depends on your data governance at your job and what you want the particular
49:22
use. I can see some companies disabling all community nodes. I can see some only allowing verified. Um, okay. You can
49:29
also change your plan over here as well. I'm just on starter for this particular account. Next, you have the billing side
49:35
of it. You can see when payments were coming through and things like that. Just going to blur my payment method
49:41
down below so you guys do not see that. But yeah, I am paying the $24 a month for this account. And then you also have
49:47
an export. So click here to download a copy of your workflows from the latest N cloud backup, which is nice. So you
49:53
should probably download a copy of your workflows occasionally just to save them if you particular need that. So I'm
49:59
going to go back over here and go to this dashboard on that side of things.
50:04
And we're going to go and click open instance. And what you'll see if we click open instance, take a look. We are
50:11
back on the overview side of things. So, that is going to be the admin panel.
50:17
Next thing we're going to do is go into templates. And honestly, I don't really use templates that often, but if you
50:24
want to download a template specifically from NAN's website, you can just click on that. Here are some featured
50:30
templates. So, you can see for example, create daily newsletter digest from Gmail using GPT41 mini research
50:36
assistant for WhatsApp using Twilio Flexity and Claude. analyze website backlinks with top backlink checker and
50:42
API Google Sheets logging. So if you have a particular use case and you don't know where to start, sometimes templates
50:48
can be pretty helpful on that side of things. And you know, honestly, I should be using templates a lot more than I do.
50:54
Again, I don't really use templates that often because I kind of stubborn and I want to build everything myself, but they could be a great starting point.
51:01
And if you click over to see more templates, you can actually see 7,536 workflow automation templates over here.
51:08
You can see who wrote or who built a specific template. They have a verified graders and whatnot. And actually, I do
51:16
have a template on the website. In fact, I plan on putting a lot more over here in the future. I'm curious if I type my
51:23
name if we uh have it over here. No, I don't. Believe I I put binary data on
51:30
here. So, let me see. Oh, here we go. And I I haven't even updated my image. This is some very poor
51:38
text and copywriting, but you can see I I just wanted to test one out here on the forums and we could also cover how
51:45
to publish a template as well on the side of things. And I actually think this would be a pretty cool uh video to
51:51
talk about or not video but a section in the course because I do think there's value in sharing some particular
51:56
templates whether you want to share it for free or paid because both of them are available over here. But yeah, this is just an example. And when you take a
52:03
look at templates on the N forms, what you can see is you can actually zoom in, you can grab different sections. We'll
52:10
be covering a lot more here in the future. I just talked about this was on the YouTube channel. I embedded a
52:15
YouTube video over here. You can see the different examples I put through over here as well as some text. But you can
52:22
go back into templates if you want to click on another one. Let's say generate AI videos with Bolato.
52:30
And actually I just listened to a podcast I believe by the creator of that on and they publish a podcast but you
52:36
can see I'm going over here this person over here uploaded a video as well
52:41
there's documentation so documentation on notion requirement doc and then you can see there's different steps over
52:48
here select idea step two image video ad script posts automations and some really
52:56
cool stuff going on over here I still like I said I still got to check out that note I've heard some great things about it. It's on my tutorial backlog.
53:01
Maybe we'll throw it in this course as well. But yeah, so that's an option over here. And if you actually click use for
53:07
free, this will populate directly within your n instance. So you can see import
53:13
template to rhinol and data cloud workspace, copy template to clipboard as JSON, open self-hosting, installation
53:20
docs. We're going to cover this more in the future, I promise you on that side of things. I don't want to take away from the UI side of it for this part of
53:27
the video. But yeah, that's what templates essentially allows you to do. Sorry if I spent a little too long over
53:32
there. Okay, next we have insights. And I just don't have insights because I'm not on the pro plan. This is more of an
53:40
impact if you have a a plan for a particular business. You can see a lot
53:45
of stuff is just it's not filled out. Again, I want to look at more time saved here in the future, but you can see I
53:51
don't even really get that breakdown on that side of things. So, I just haven't
53:57
really filled that out. Okay. So, next you have your help section. So, there's quite a few things over here. So, it
54:02
says, "Share your workflow with others, unlock perks, and become a featured template creator. Become a creator." Again, we're going to cover that a
54:08
little bit for the future. You have a quick start guide, which honestly, if you guys are watching this video, you probably won't need to use that. You
54:14
have documentation, which I use actually quite a bit. I think some people think they're too good for the documentation,
54:19
like, "Oh, I can figure things out." But the N team does a really great job when it comes to documenting how nodes work.
54:26
And u I would re really recommend if you if you don't understand how a node works or if you want to get some clarity,
54:32
check out the documentation. We're going to open up that here in a second. Next, you have NAN community forums. So we'll
54:38
go over there. You have a report of bugs section about NE. Uh, next over here is your change log like what is new, what
54:44
is NAM bringing in instance level MCP guardrail nodes, new ways to authenticate MCP client tool. All these
54:51
we're going to cover here in the course. You can see the full change log and then if you're behind on a version which you guys saw I'm on the latest version. Uh,
54:57
you would want to click over here and it'll go back into your admin panel. So just to show you the any end docs really
55:03
fast. So where you go over here you can look for a specific node and just try to
55:08
find it. So you could go and search something. For example, let's say nan
55:14
loop over items documentation.
55:20
So I'm just going to go over here and you can see loop over items. It says when to use it, node parameters and what
55:27
they have is templates and examples on this side of things. Read RSS feed from two different sources. There's an
55:33
example over here. View workflow file. Again, more JSON on that side of things.
55:38
get the current running index of this node. So like a lot of really great documentation in my personal opinion all
55:45
on one side of things and you can see built-in nodes you have cluster nodes credentials community nodes again very
55:51
great documentation feel free to read into it see cluster nodes talk a lot more about that but uh one other thing
55:57
we'll cover this once we get into the UI is actually if you click into a node they'll often have a say a section that
56:03
says either look at a template or read into the documentation so that is all there here's the n community so this is
56:10
another great spot to kind of just network with people, uh, see what people are building and things like that. I
56:15
don't use the community as much as I really should, but one of the best aspects of NAN is kind of the community
56:21
that they've fostered. Like it's a very great community. You can see we need your help. There's 28 replies, 50,000
56:26
views. Welcome to N community, 16,000 views. So like a lot of people are pretty active on here. OOTH issues. You
56:33
can see people put questions that aren't working or they share things as well. There's a lot of different topics,
56:38
announcements, questions, tutorials built with N and you can see the people that are responding or whatnot. Lastly,
56:45
our release notes. So, just based off of here like what is going on with N. So, you can see like when there's a new
56:51
version, they talk about what is being changed. I use release notes just to kind of know what's happening with N and
56:57
kind of helps me make some YouTube videos like, oh, they just put this in N. I should probably cover this on a a
57:03
video on the channel. So, you know, maybe it's not as important for you, but if you want to take a look at release
57:09
notes before you update, or if you just want to see what's new to the software, you know, you can see what's new over
57:14
here. Or you can just like really go into the release notes and press that used to release notes a little bit more. All right, so that covers essentially
57:21
that side of it, which is insights. Sorry, that covers also the helps section. That wasn't insights. Lastly,
57:27
you have settings, which is quite a few different settings over here. Uh, if we click on one, it'll go to everything. So
57:33
we'll just go over here and go to settings. So you have the personal side of things. Then you have your users that
57:39
are in your instance. You have different roles uh for projects, but that's only available on enterprise plans. I'm not
57:45
going to click on that because enterprise is really really expensive. You have the N API, which I haven't used
57:51
as of yet. Maybe I'll take a look at this here in the future. You have external secrets. Again, available
57:56
enterprise plan. So I don't have that. You have environments enterprise plan. Don't have access to that. If you have
58:02
SSO again enterprise plan, I do not have that. LDAP do not have that as well.
58:10
Loging uh is a paid feature. So don't have available on that. You have community notes that is something I do
58:17
have. So as I mentioned, you know, community nodes are things that companies will build and they want to
58:22
put this in directly into N because a lot of people use their software. For example, there's firecrawl over here.
58:28
There's ampify that I've used. their SER API and you can see the versions of these and it says you're up to date, you
58:33
up to date, you were up to date, but if you weren't in the most current version, it would tell you you could update it over there. You can take a look at the
58:40
documentation and you can uninstall Ka nodes as well all in one particular place. You can also access all this on
58:45
your particular canvas. Uh you have a migration report. Now why the migration import is important when people are
58:51
moving from version one to version two of any n there are things that are going to break with the Python code node as
58:58
well as the subworkflow node and yeah so this tells you what workflows are
59:03
particular impacted with that I've actually covered this in a lot greater detail in our nan v2 stuff but if you're
59:09
watching this video chances are you're probably brand new to any you don't really have to worry about this in
59:14
particular the next is the instance level MCP so it says let mcp clients like flawed, lovable, and other AI
59:19
tools. Discover and execute your NAN workflows. So, actually, we're going to be doing this a little bit later on in
59:25
this course. I haven't actually recorded the particular YouTube video for this as of yet. It's in my backlog. But, uh, I
59:32
guess we're going to put it in the course first and then I'll have the breakdown of a YouTube video on there. And then lastly, you have chat settings.
59:38
So, we'll cover this a little bit more a little bit later on in the course when we cover into chat. But you can see we
59:44
have a specific provider, what models are available and things like that. You can you can choose different options,
59:51
whether you want to enable it in chat or not, limit the models. Again, we're going to talk about that later in the course. I don't want to spend all the
59:57
time doing that. And then just clicking back, you are back into uh this homepage, which is going to be overview.
1:00:04
A few other just quick minor things I want to cover really fast for you. So, first we already covered the sidebar. So
1:00:11
you can see how that has next thing you can click this plus you can create a new workflow you can create a new credential
1:00:17
or you can create a new project and then lastly what we have over here is a command bar and a lot of people like the
1:00:22
command bar and I actually haven't seen a lot of people talk about it but this allows you to go into recent actions. So
1:00:27
you can see like open RSS feed node which is a video I published open AI nodes another video I published open any
1:00:34
chat you have workflows create a new workflow open a workflow projects create a project open a project uh credentials
1:00:41
you have data tables over here execution you can go to navigation what's new chat
1:00:46
templates variables so a lot of things I already showed you over here you have the help guide but this is just all available in uh this search rather than
1:00:53
just going through all that over here which can save some time for some particular power users. What I want to
1:01:00
do now is just go into create a workflow and show you a few other things really fast and then uh and we'll call this for
1:01:07
lecture number two. So I'm just going to go over here into create workflow and let's cover some of these specific
1:01:14
basics. So going into the canvas again, you'll see that we have the sidebar. Personally, I like having as much space
1:01:20
as possible. So, all I'm going to do is just collapse this sidebar. And you can see you have a little bit more room. And
1:01:27
the first thing you should notice is we have our sections over here, which is editor, executions, as well as
1:01:33
evaluations. Again, we'll cover all these more in particular detail in the future. Executions is when you run your
1:01:39
particular workflow. Obviously, we haven't even built out a workflow yet. So, this is going to be blank.
1:01:44
Valuations help when you're building out AI workflows or AI orchestration. And
1:01:50
there's a lot of nuances behind it. You can see you only have one uh for the individual side of things and I'll have
1:01:57
to delete it for this course, but that's fine. And we're back into our particular editor. So those are your three options
1:02:03
over here. When you want to save a workflow, what you want to do is click over here and mention that it is save.
1:02:09
Uh so now you can see my workflow is saved. You can change the name really, really easily. So you can see how it
1:02:15
says my workflow 12 over here. All I'm going to do over here is say section two
1:02:20
interface tour. Interface tour. And boom, we have re saved our thing. And
1:02:27
you can see it's saved. We have the new name as well. And if we go back into our overview, you can see at the very top it
1:02:33
says section 2 interface store. And that is our workflow that we have for here. And it says last updated just now
1:02:39
created December 26. So all of that is on that side of things. What's great is
1:02:45
you could add a first step. You could start from a template which we've already covered the templates or you could build with AI as well. So just
1:02:52
going over here you could essentially ask AI to start building out the framework of a workflow or you can start
1:02:59
from a template or you could start from scratch. Now I'm going to really preach kind of learning the basics and building
1:03:04
things out first before you ask AI. It kind of goes back into vibe coding. What happens with vibe coding is a lot of
1:03:10
people just have no idea what is going on in the code and you have bigger issues later on. So it's super important to know the fundamentals of any end
1:03:16
before you start using templates or building with AI in my personal opinion.
1:03:21
All right, next side of it what you're going to see. So you have all these different things over here. Open nodes
1:03:27
panel, you have the command bar, you have add a sticky note, you have the focus panel, and then you have any nai
1:03:33
as well on that side of things. We're going to cover each of these here in a second. You have the three dots over here which is more setting options. Uh
1:03:40
you can see edit description, duplicate, download, share, change owner, rename, import from URL or from file settings.
1:03:47
You could archive it and then you have different things like it says zoom to fit, uh zoom in, zoom out, and then also
1:03:54
tidy up. So let's walk through a few of these over here. First, we've already covered this command bar before, and you
1:04:00
can see it just shows up. It is the same thing as over here, right? So two different options just for these power
1:04:06
users that want to just go over here, grab it, or you can go over here. Okay, next thing. This is what you're going to use a lot, which is your nodes panel.
1:04:13
So, you can click this plus icon. When you initially start your workflow, it's going to prompt you to use a trigger.
1:04:19
We're going to cover triggers in greater detail, but let's go over here to the basic one and say trigger manually. And
1:04:26
we'll just click that. And now, what you'll see is it ask for a specific node. You can use another trigger, which
1:04:31
again we're going to cover. You have AI nodes. So you can click over here and you can see all of these different nodes
1:04:37
as well as all these over here. Then you have an action in a particular app which
1:04:43
you can see there's no way anyone's ever going to cover all of these. There's just so many and I'm and I keep
1:04:48
scrolling and you can see there's more and more and more are going to be added over here. If you see this check mark
1:04:53
over here, it says this is an official node maintained by that specific company. So these are going to be your
1:04:58
community nodes whereas these are native nodes like the sticky notes on there. You have data transformations which
1:05:05
again there's the popular section here at the top add or remove items combine items convert data and other. Then what
1:05:12
you have next is flow. So essentially how you want to change the direction and you guys might think I'm going fast
1:05:17
right now. Promise you we're going to learn about everything over here. We're just covering the interface right now. Uh we have our core side of it as well
1:05:26
and given in the loop and again if you want to add another trigger you have that option. One thing as well is once
1:05:32
you know essentially what node you want to use, you're going to be searching quite a bit. So like imagine if I just
1:05:38
wanted a text classification node, uh you can just see I say text and I already know text classifiers here. So I
1:05:44
don't really have to dive in and click AI and go say, "Hey, where's the text classifier? Oh, right over here." And I
1:05:51
promise you like the more and more you use any N you'll have ideas in your mind like, "Oh, I need to use this type of
1:05:57
node." you just search it and it really does save you quite a bit of time. I'm going to close these out really fast so
1:06:03
we can just go back into this. Uh sticky notes are really important. We're going to talk about this on the documentation
1:06:08
side of the course. Uh but there's quite a bit that you can do with sticky notes. You saw I added in a video over here. I
1:06:14
add in text. You can do different headers. Uh you could also add in images over here. You can change the color of
1:06:19
these. And sticky notes populate behind nodes which is really helpful. So let's say I have a schedule trigger and you
1:06:26
can see the sticky note is behind it on there. I just again I find sticky notes very helpful on that side of things.
1:06:33
Again, I just find sticky notes very helpful. One other thing that you have is this focus panel. So let me just show you when you're going to specifically
1:06:39
use that. So let me put in a agent and we'll have a whole AI agent setting or
1:06:44
section multiple sections on AI agents. So don't worry if you're a little confused over there. But if I want to
1:06:50
click into the AI agent, I'm going to click over here to define below. You'll see that we have a prompt that we need
1:06:56
to specifically write. And if you're not familiar with the prompt, don't worry. It's just essentially text that you want
1:07:02
to tell an AI to do something. Well, you know, this is just one screen. What if I wanted to see the whole workflow while
1:07:08
I'm writing this prompt? So, click your focus parameter. And you can see I'm going to say write a generic
1:07:16
email. And I'm just going to say that over here. And you can see write a
1:07:21
generic email is over here as well. And if I actually click this, it's going to start the workflow. And it says run the
1:07:27
current node will also run previous nodes if they have not been run yet. So I'm not going to do that. But you could also just run this AI agent on this side
1:07:34
of things right here. And if you haven't run the previous nodes, it'll run those up into that AI agent to perform that
1:07:40
particular task. So something that's pretty helpful. Again, we'll cover that here in the future. Uh next with our our
1:07:48
specific chat trigger node, one of the things you'll find if we actually open this up, you can actually have a chat
1:07:53
with it and you'll see this down below. Again, we'll cover this in greater detail when we talk about the chat, but
1:07:59
that is available over there. Okay, so now let's talk about these. So one of the things I find sometimes is, and this
1:08:07
happens on my laptop more than my desktop, sometimes it'll zoom like way out. It's like these nodes just they
1:08:14
turn out to be like this and you can see like I I don't know what's going on. Honestly, I wish the N any team would
1:08:20
solve this because I just I can't see what's going on and you don't even know like there's a node like you can't see that. Well, the way that you fix this is
1:08:26
you just say zoom in to fit and congrats you are back into that area. I think the N team shouldn't have it zoom out that
1:08:33
far. Like I don't think there's any ever going to be a workflow that uh needs that much space. In fact, you can't even
1:08:39
see the nodes. Uh so that should be limited but that ever happens to you zoom to fit and that took me too much
1:08:45
time to admit again you can zoom in you can zoom out over here uh you have an
1:08:50
action to reset the zoom which is that over here which only populates when you change your zoom. So again like if you
1:08:56
you go way out over here and you want to reset it done. Okay. And next thing is
1:09:02
the tidy up. So again this is going to be kind of more of a section when we have a bunch of nodes going on. Let's
1:09:08
just throw in some random stuff like not anything in too particular. We'll go over here. We'll do like an edit set. Do
1:09:16
not do what I'm doing right now. I'm just kind of just showing you something really weird. And this means absolutely
1:09:22
nothing. So nothing in here should be replicated with this workflow. So please
1:09:28
don't do that. I mean if you want to you can but like really there's nothing. So like this looks like gibberish and
1:09:34
you're like all right this not something that's worth presenting on YouTube. it's not worth something presenting to a client like you need to organize it and
1:09:41
you know a lot of people just go okay let me organize it and put all this over here and this is simple right we have
1:09:47
five total nodes one trigger and four nodes over here but it does take time if you have 20 or 30 nodes so what can
1:09:55
happen well if you just click this tidy up boom like two seconds like it doesn't matter how disgusting this is like
1:10:03
please again do not make your workflows like this like I have I have legit Legitimately no idea what the order is.
1:10:08
Taking a look at this and this is terrible. Done. Tidy up. So a very
1:10:13
impactful setting. Lastly, you have any N AI over here. So it says like what would you like me to automate? You have
1:10:19
monthly credits associated with this. So you can just ask it to help you with your particular workflow. I'm going to
1:10:25
cover this later on in the course as well as a particular video on my YouTube channel. Uh and you can see that this is
1:10:32
in beta. You could ask a question or you could also build and you have different credits based off of your plan.
1:10:40
So that is essentially the interface. I think we covered everything. Oh, few
1:10:45
things. So two things I forgot to show you guys. Uh first is your workflow
1:10:51
history. So I'm just going to say leave without saying and you can see your versions over here. And it says version
1:10:58
history is limited to one day upgrade plan to activate full history which I think is kind of a bummer on that side
1:11:04
of things but you can see your version history there. Uh the other thing as well is you have these three dots and
1:11:10
you can see there's quite a few things. So edit description clear descriptions help other users and MCP clients understand the purpose of your workflow.
1:11:16
So as you build out a lot more workflows and you want to use your workflows within MCP or chat, you should write a
1:11:22
description for that particular workflow. So that is that section. If you want to duplicate your workflow, so
1:11:28
essentially if you want to create a second version of it, I do find this helpful for when you want to do some
1:11:33
sort of evaluations, I just duplicate a workflow for there. If you want to download a workflow, so essentially how
1:11:39
this works is a workflow is JSON and you download the JSON over here and you can
1:11:45
send it to a customer or you can use it somewhere else. So that's where the download is. You you can share as well.
1:11:51
So you just add in a particular user and you can share your workflow. You can change the owner of a workflow and
1:11:58
really like sharing or changing owner helps if you have multiple people. If you're just a soloreneur and you're not
1:12:03
doing workflows for other people, it's not really there. You could rename it, but it's like you could just go over
1:12:08
here. I just wouldn't recommend clicking these three extra dots. Uh you could import from a particular URL. Sometimes
1:12:14
you have a URL for a template. You can just click and import that over here. Uh
1:12:20
you can import in from file. So this is a JSON file. You can push this over to
1:12:25
git. Uh so let's say GitHub and then you have settings over here. So you have execution order there. You have error
1:12:31
workflow. So if your workflow errors, you can send it to another workflow. We're going to cover that later on in the course. Uh this workflow can be
1:12:37
called by and this allows you essentially for chat. So you can see no other workflows, workflows created,
1:12:43
selected workflows or any workflows. Uh time zone as well. You have save failed
1:12:48
production executions, save successful production, manual. Uh again just some other stuff over here. Timeout available
1:12:55
in MCP which you need to publish your workflow. I'll show you how to do that here in a second. And estimated time is
1:13:01
saved. So minutes per production execution if you want to save that there. Lastly, you might be wondering
1:13:06
like how do I publish a workflow and should be a little bit later on. But
1:13:11
let's imagine we just have the super basic workflow. We have a chat that goes into an AI agent and we have a chat
1:13:18
model over here. We're just going to add an anthropic. We'll say set45 and we just open this up over here and say I
1:13:25
don't know, we'll ask a question and uh open chat.
1:13:31
What metal band has the most Spotify plays?
1:13:38
Not that it matters in any case. And you can see our workflow is running. We received the chat message. It's going
1:13:43
into our AI agent. Again, if you don't know what is going on, we're going to cover in greater details. But you can
1:13:49
see have our output over here on this side of things. We have our input. It says human which is us. Uh then you can
1:13:54
see the logs of what is going on. And then you can see our response over here on that side of things. So let's say hey
1:14:01
this is great. I want to publish this. So how do you do that? First what you should do is save this and then click on
1:14:06
publish. You just say version one. We'll say section two. Section two interface.
1:14:16
Um and then we'll describe our changes added in chat trigger AI agent. Now why
1:14:22
this is really important in software programming what you do is something called versioning. So essentially you just keep building different versions of
1:14:29
your software. Sometimes things will break. So it's super important that you describe all of your changes in over here. So that way someone more senior
1:14:36
within your company knows essentially what is going on. And then you also you set version naming as you can see like
1:14:41
with any they set specific versions of their software. You can do the same thing with like versions of your particular workflows. So, I'll just
1:14:47
click publish and you'll see it says workflow published. You can now make calls to your production chat URL. So,
1:14:53
this is available in MCP as well as our chat. And you can see there's a production checklist over here as well.
1:14:58
I'm just going to ignore this for now. We're going to probably cover this a little bit later on as a section in this course. And you like, okay, cool. Well,
1:15:05
I can't unpublish this over here. How do I do that? Click these three dots. And then you just go over here to unpublish.
1:15:11
We'll click unpublish. And the workflow has been unpublished. And again, if you want to hide the chat, just click that.
1:15:18
So, we have covered a ton for just uh section two, which is our interface.
1:15:24
Hopefully, this cleared up any type of confusion that you had. Our next section, we're going to start covering the core concepts of N. We're just going
1:15:31
to honestly start from the workflow page over here. I'm going to create a brand new workflow for us to go through and
1:15:37
keep up the great work. Uh we're about to jump into some awesome stuff and you're honestly just a few lectures away
1:15:43
from learning how this AI agent works and building out your first AI automations. All right, I'll see you in
1:15:48
lecture number three right now. So the last section we talked about where different components are within N. Now
1:15:55
what I want to do is really dive into what makes up a workflow in Nan and talk
1:16:00
a little bit more about triggers as well as nodes. We're going to actually build our first workflow in this section as
1:16:07
well. So, some pretty exciting stuff over there. Your hello world essentially for Nan version two. So, let's jump
1:16:13
right into it. All right. So, what I have is a another brand new section and
1:16:19
we're going to start off with a trigger. Now, every workflow has to start with a
1:16:25
trigger. Triggers will start those off. And as I showed you in the last section, you'll go over here and it says what
1:16:32
triggers this workflow. You could start off with manually, which personally I use probably about 80% of the time
1:16:38
within testing. You can have an app event. So imagine you have some sort of
1:16:44
uh CRM, which is essentially a way to save data on customers and you just
1:16:50
added a new customer into your CRM that could start a workflow. Or what happens
1:16:56
if you get a particular email for a contract? Well, that could also start a workflow. So this is where an on app
1:17:02
event looks like and just to show you like there is hundreds if not thousands in here in any end and what's really
1:17:09
cool is when we talk a little bit later web hooks essentially are on app events but for things that are not here in any
1:17:16
end and uh you can see I keep scrolling and there's more and more and more you
1:17:22
can do a schedule so you can say hey I want this workflow to run 9:00 a.m. on
1:17:27
business days and it will do that. Or hey, I want this workflow to run three times a day, 9:00 a.m., noon, as well as
1:17:34
5:00 p.m. Well, you can set up a schedule to do that as well. Here are web hooks, which I talked about on App
1:17:40
Event. So, essentially, web hooks are for things uh outside of Nan or if the option is not available in Nan, they can
1:17:47
be a little bit complicated to set up. So, web hooks is going to be a full section by itself. Here in this course,
1:17:53
you'll have a specific form. So essentially what you have is just like a web form. Someone fills out some
1:17:59
information, it starts a workflow. You can actually start a workflow from another workflow. The chat message which
1:18:05
we covered a little bit earlier. Uh when running evaluations which is a little bit outside and then we have other ways
1:18:11
over here you have an email trigger error triggers again outside MCP we'll
1:18:16
have a full section over it. Nan handle events and perform actions on your nan instance and then your SSE triggers. So
1:18:23
again, we'll just start something super basic and have a trigger manually. So again, we'll just start something basic and do a trigger manual over here. Next,
1:18:31
you have nodes. And we already covered all the different parts of nodes in the previous section. So I'm not going to
1:18:38
cover that in greater detail, but typically your workflow is going to be filled with different nodes. And you
1:18:43
might be wondering like, oh, how like how do I know what node to use? I promise you, you'll pick up the skill
1:18:48
really, really fast. And sometimes you'll want to build out diagrams essentially kind of like a flowchart like what's going to happen each step.
1:18:55
We'll cover that as well a little bit later on in the course. And again we covered also community nodes. So if you
1:19:00
want to look for a community node you can see over here we have this this is a node from our community. It's part of
1:19:06
the ampify side of it over here. And then you can see this is official node maintained by the WhatsApp notifications
1:19:12
by syncmate. Okay. So we have that over there. Let's talk about how data flows
1:19:18
in NE. So what we're going to do is actually build out a edit set and this is going to be one of the most popular
1:19:24
nodes that we're going to use here in NE. We'll actually cover this in greater detail a little bit later on. But we
1:19:31
have our edit set and what we're going to do in this edit set is we're just going to go over here and write
1:19:38
something here in a section. So we'll say put name and just put your name over
1:19:44
here. We'll see Ryan's and what we'll do is have another edit
1:19:51
set that's just want to do this to show you how our
1:19:56
data flows. So essentially what you can see is we start our workflow and it goes over here and says one item and we go
1:20:03
into our edit fields over here and you can see we have our input for the node.
1:20:08
We have our node settings and different options and our parameters over here. And then we have our particular output
1:20:15
on this side of things. And you can see it says name Ryan Nolan. This is our schema view. We have our table as well
1:20:21
as our JSON view. And most of the time you'll see three different views over here. There's option with binary files.
1:20:27
I don't even want you to worry about that as of yet. We're going to cover that later on. Um, but you can see
1:20:33
anytime we click into a node, you'll have your input over here. You have the settings and your output. And you can
1:20:39
see that there's no output over here because I never really filled out any settings. So that is why that is particularly correct over here. And you
1:20:46
can see one item goes through each of these things. Now, one of the confusing points for people is like what happens
1:20:52
if there's multiple items? Some people think, oh, each of these go one item at a time throughout a workflow. That is
1:20:59
not the case. What I'm going to just show you, it's a little bit more advanced, but I think it's super important for me to cover this right
1:21:05
now. So, I'm just going to go over here and we're going to go and add our second example. So, we're going to create a new
1:21:11
edit set. So, edit set and I'm going to create something called an array. Now,
1:21:16
we'll say example array. And again, don't worry too much about arrays. We're going to cover this in greater detail. I'm just going to go over here array and
1:21:22
we're going to put two metal bands. We'll say Metallica and I'll put Mega Death over here.
1:21:31
And this is an array. But why I want to show this to you is
1:21:36
our array right now is one item. We're going to split this out. Split out.
1:21:41
And with an array, when you split out an array, it turns into multiple items.
1:21:47
And then what we're going to do is do an AI agent.
1:21:52
What was the most popular album for?
1:21:59
Just pass this in over here. Again, a lot of this is going to look foreign and uh forgot to put a chat model over here.
1:22:07
It's fine. Don't worry about this for this example. All we're doing is talking about file data flows. So, I'm just
1:22:14
going to find many. Great. Save that.
1:22:22
And once this populates, show you. All right. So, this workflow ran. So let me
1:22:28
explain how nan works with particular items. So what happens is we have one
1:22:33
item that starts the workflow and it populates over here. Okay. Then we have one item from this edit fields which is
1:22:40
just an array. Again we'll cover arrays a little bit later. So that's one item. It populates over here. We took each of
1:22:47
these elements within an array and we split this out and turned it into two items. Now this is where the confusion
1:22:53
happens for a lot of people. They think, "Oh, well, how any end works is again, maybe you start off with a trigger that
1:23:00
has multiple items." Well, it just goes one item at a time for everything and then it restarts and goes one item at a
1:23:06
time. That is not the case in nan all the items process through one node
1:23:12
before it goes into the next node. So, you can see one item that's self one item and then it has two items. So, for
1:23:20
example, if I have another node over here, right? And let's just say like I don't know, we'll do like Google Sheets
1:23:26
or add it to a data table. Let's say we want to insert a row into a data table. Obviously, I'm not going to fill this out right now. Um the two items are
1:23:33
going to process through the AI agent and then the two items are sent to insert row and these two items are going to be inserted into row. It's not hey,
1:23:40
we're just going to go through one item for each of these nodes. Go back around and one item through each of these
1:23:45
nodes. And I think there's a lot of confusion on that because what happens is I see people that have a loop over
1:23:51
items and they think okay how and works is it just has one item at a time. That
1:23:56
is not how it works. Again all items are going to be processed through a specific node. Once that is done it goes on to
1:24:03
that next node. So it does not work one item at a time and goes through this.
1:24:08
Every single item will be processed through a node and then it goes into the next node. Again, this is a little bit
1:24:14
complicated right now and you'll see this over time, but I just want to preach this super early on because it
1:24:21
does trip up quite a few people. Again, for a third time, every single item is
1:24:26
processed through a node before the next node happens. So, when we have these two items, but both items are processed in
1:24:32
our AI agent before we go into inserting a row within this data table. And
1:24:38
obviously I didn't connect this up, but then I would insert these two rows based off of what's over here and then go on
1:24:44
to the next node with those those items. All right, hopefully that makes sense.
1:24:50
Another thing that's pretty impactful here in N is pinning items. And why this
1:24:56
is really important, two reasons. Number one, when you use a service, let's say for example, uh, OpenAI or use some sort
1:25:03
of API, there is a cost associated with it. And you know, if you're going to keep running the same data over and over
1:25:09
again, it's just going to cost you for testing. So instead of constantly having to go to OpenAI and run uh their model,
1:25:18
you can just pin their data. So you can see it says pin data. Node will always output the current data instead of executing. So now anytime we go to this
1:25:25
node, the data is already saved over here. And this is also sometimes
1:25:31
tripping up people because they forget they pinned the data and they're like why is my workflow not working? Well, that's because you have pinned the data
1:25:38
and the data over here might be wrong or it might not be what you're testing. So, it's a double-edged sword. One side of
1:25:44
it, it's great because you don't have to constantly call different APIs. You aren't have to have additional costs in
1:25:50
here. You can save things for testing. And just to show you like we can pin all of these different items
1:25:56
and you'll see that they have this icon over here for the pin. Again, super super helpful on that side of things.
1:26:03
And when we run a workflow, it will automatically populate through these. Like this will take like a second and you can see done. Whereas in the past
1:26:10
when you saw this screen, our AI agent took a little bit to run. Might have cut out how long it took for that AI agent.
1:26:16
Regardless, this took like 30 seconds, 60 seconds to get the answer for these two particular items. Now, that's
1:26:23
pending. Literally takes a second, but it's always going to be the same exact data. So, it will save you a lot of
1:26:29
money when you're testing with particular APIs and it can save you time if you have an elaborate workflow of 30 40 nodes and uh you have to pin some of
1:26:36
this data because it just takes forever. So, highly recommend learning about pinning data and you can pin it, you can
1:26:42
unpin it. And just to show you when we unpin it, go like that and it is gone. Also to mention you can modify the data
1:26:49
that is in over here. All you have to do is click the pencil icon and let's say I want to put in slayer instead of meade.
1:26:55
You can just put slayer over here and you can save it. And this data has been modified in that particular. So we could
1:27:02
send that over here as well. And you can see it's just saved. So just another thing that's a little bit helpful. You
1:27:08
might see it in some YouTube videos and you're confused what they're doing. Well, they just updated that over there.
1:27:14
Okay. So, we talked about pinning data. We talked about items. Uh we've already talked about as well as the input
1:27:20
output, right? You can see input output as well. You can see again we have this data is pinned for test executions. You
1:27:27
see that over there. Okay. We've talked about the different ways you could view it with the schema, the table as well as
1:27:34
JSON. We'll cover that in greater detail in the future. One of the other things I
1:27:39
want to talk about is passing data between nodes. So, we saw this a little
1:27:44
bit here and uh let me show you how that particularly works. All right. So, what
1:27:51
we're going to do is we're just going to grab our start over here and we're going
1:27:57
to go and grab our edit set. So, edit set and we're going to just
1:28:05
start this off and we're going to do another name side of it. So, you'll see on this I think I'll just put like last
1:28:12
name and we're I'll just put my last name over here, Nolan.
1:28:18
And then what I'll do next is we'll just uh we can use any node. Let's just use
1:28:23
an AI agent for fun. And the only purpose of this, by the
1:28:29
way, is just to show you something called an expression versus fix. So fix
1:28:35
essentially all you do is write some text over here. And there's nothing dynamic about this. You could say like
1:28:41
who won series in 2021 or 2022. It doesn't matter,
1:28:48
right? Like this is fixed. It's always going to say the same exact message over and over again. But that doesn't really
1:28:54
get the benefit of orchestration why we're using any end. So one of the things that's really cool is if we click
1:29:00
over here and go into expressions, we can actually pass in dynamic data and we can say who is the most famous person
1:29:10
with the name and you can just grab over here. You can see I have last name Nolan
1:29:16
from the previous node and I can pass that in. Who is the most famous person with the name Nolan? Now, this probably
1:29:22
is going to be either Nolan Ryan or the um film director. What is it?
1:29:27
Christopher Nolan. So, one of those two will probably populate on that side of things. But what's really cool is
1:29:34
because we're in this expression, we're able to pass over this from the previous
1:29:39
node and it dynamically adds this in as JSON in over here to our prompt.
1:29:46
Hopefully, a light bulb just clicked. And you might be wondering like, do I always have to click over here into expression? Well, yeah, because you can
1:29:52
see if it's fixed, it just has this over here and it's not highlighted. So again, a source of debugging. If you see this,
1:29:58
you're going to get a specific error. And one other thing to note is it automatically goes to expression if you
1:30:03
drag this over here. Now, I find it a little bit buggy at times. So you can see what happens. I grab this last name,
1:30:08
go over here, and it's like it's kind of forcing me to throw this here in the beginning. So
1:30:14
sometimes it works and it populates in the correct spot. Sometimes it'll populate a little bit weird. I just find
1:30:19
it easier. I click into expression and then drag and drop it because either way I have to adjust this in some capacity,
1:30:26
but this will pass in that additional data from the previous note. Again, light bulbs should be clicking. You're
1:30:31
like, "Wow, this is really, really cool." Um, okay. A few other things as well. As I mentioned about the
1:30:37
documentation a little bit earlier, you can see in the AI agent says, "Tip get a feel for AI agents with our quick tutorial or see an example how this node
1:30:44
works." You can actually click in over these and you'll see a tutorial build an AI agent with an N. So you have this
1:30:51
YouTube video they embedded. They have all the information over here and lot of great examples in their documentation
1:30:56
docs.n.io. You can continue to do that with all these particular nodes. If I go back
1:31:03
over here, oh sorry, this is the example that they showed, right? I just populated a new workflow. I'm not going
1:31:09
to save that. But if you go into our edit set, we'll see as well. They actually Oh, here's the docs on the side
1:31:15
of things. So, you can see you click onto the docs and it says edit fields set. It's a core node and it has all the
1:31:22
information on here. You can see also there's templates and examples and uh
1:31:27
yeah, that's just built out directly on that side of things. So, you can just click onto those docs or if there's an
1:31:33
option right over here, they give you both of those and go back into AI agent. You can see the docs of the AI agent is
1:31:39
right over here. So, a lot of different options and you can close this out if you want. I'm just going to keep it uh
1:31:44
for this particular tutorial. I just find it pretty helpful. All right. So, we covered triggers, we covered nodes,
1:31:51
we covered how does the data flow. Remember, one item at a time. All we covered how data flows. Remember, all
1:31:58
the items pass through each node at a time. It's not one item at a time like a lot of people assume. We showed you how
1:32:04
to modify and pin data, the input and output, different ways to view the data,
1:32:09
whether it's schema, table, or JSON. We talked about going in over here and you
1:32:15
have the options for fix versus expression and you can see like this constantly is an option on these side of
1:32:20
things. Let's talk about like what happens with an error now. So like how do you know something errored out? Well,
1:32:27
I'm going to purposely error this AI agent out because I don't have a chat model associated with it. So you'll see
1:32:33
if there's an error, you said it says problem with node. It says a chat sub node must be connected and enabled. And
1:32:40
you'll see that this has a red X and it says issues a chat. And it actually tells you exactly what the error is. And
1:32:46
you know, the more that you build out workflows and the more that you test, the more you'll understand why specific
1:32:52
errors happen. And this one's a pretty easy one. But this also just tells us that there's an error. And it's easy
1:32:58
alert. Also, you could see this in executions. I'm just going to save this over here. And I'll go into executions.
1:33:04
And you'll see that there is an error. and it says error in 28 milliseconds in.
1:33:09
What's really cool is we can actually debug in the editor and it copies exactly what you tested and it will go
1:33:15
back into our editor and save the data that you tested with. And this is really really helpful if you have a lot of
1:33:21
different items going on and like one particular item breaks the workflow like it's a weird edge case and I use that
1:33:27
all the time. I just go to executions I debug an editor from that exact error. Uh so you can use that and there's other
1:33:35
options as well if you want to restart your workflow and again we'll talk a lot more about this in error handling but
1:33:40
you can retry with currently saved workflow or retry with the original workflow as well. Uh but that is errors
1:33:45
just pretty important to cover this at least the basics right now early on in the course and yeah so what I want you
1:33:53
to do now is let's build our first workflow together. So I have been
1:33:59
essentially teaching you the guys things for the last what hour and a half and I
1:34:05
think it's time to build your work first workflow. So I'm going to say build
1:34:10
your work first workflow and essentially what we're going to do is we're going to build out the hello
1:34:16
world hello world of any end. So how do I want this to start? Well what I want
1:34:23
you to do is start with a manual trigger. So start with the manual trigger as I've showed you. Then what I
1:34:28
want you to do is go into the set node. So we'll go to the set node and inside the set node, what I want you to do is
1:34:35
literally just write hello world. I'm learning any
1:34:45
and yeah. So what I want you to do now is just pause the video and build this
1:34:51
out. And one thing to note before we do that is this over here. This to start
1:34:57
the workflow. You only can have one of these per uh workflow. So you're going to have to detach this and just bring
1:35:04
that over here. Okay. Uh a little bit of nuance. And if you already paused and you're jumping into this, I am so sorry.
1:35:10
And that's why I've been dragging this throughout the video. So pause the video now, attempt this, and I will show you
1:35:16
the solution. Okay, guys. So hopefully you were able to solve this. All we're
1:35:22
going to do is click this plus icon over here. We're going to search for edit set, edit field set, and you'll see we
1:35:29
have this over here. We're going to keep the mode manual mapping. And we'll cover a lot more of the detail here in a second. And we're going to click add in
1:35:36
field. And I didn't tell you specifically what to call this field, but just going over here, I'm going to
1:35:42
call this hello world. So hello world. And then we need to pass in a value. By
1:35:48
default, we're lucky this is strings and you probably don't know what all these are as of yet. It's tough to cover
1:35:54
everything at once, but this is a future lecture. We're going to cover all of these. But all we're going to do is copy
1:35:59
this. Hello world. I'm learning nan. So just grab all of that. Go in here and paste that.
1:36:07
Hello world. I'm learning nan. I'm going to execute this step. And you can see we have this over here. Hello world learning nan. And let's run this and
1:36:16
take a look. We have our input which is the manual trigger. We have our output. Hello world. Hello world. I'm learning
1:36:22
n. And hopefully you're able to get that right. Obviously this is super basic but this is your uh first step in the right
1:36:30
direction. I do want to note one other minor thing just about these workflows
1:36:36
that I think is a little bit helpful for you guys. So, I didn't really cover this in detail, but if you take a look at
1:36:43
these workflows, one things that any end team does have is first these dots that
1:36:49
allow you to kind of drag and drop to go from node to node. And then you can also see uh these arrows. So, it tells you
1:36:57
data is going from this node into this particular node. Another thing that's
1:37:03
really helpful is with triggers. You'll notice that these are not squares. they actually have a rounded left edge like
1:37:10
this. And obviously you might say, "Oh, that's just maybe the manual one." If I go to triggers and let's say on a
1:37:15
schedule, same thing, right? And we're going to cover this greater detail for the trigger section. Um, but they're not
1:37:22
squares. Like the nodes are going to be squares. The triggers are like that. And one other thing, notice there's an icon and there's something called execute
1:37:28
workflow. You can see like there's lightning over here. So that also shows you how to start a workflow. Okay. One
1:37:37
other thing and again there's there's so much with any n how do you re label these because it's just not helpful
1:37:43
seeing edit fields for if you go over here and you click on this and you can say this is uh print hello world
1:37:53
and it's super important within your workflows that you label your notes. You can see print hello world and you have
1:37:59
other settings as well. You can put notes you can display the note in the world and it's and we can say print
1:38:06
Hello world learning in AI and we're going to display this note inflow and you can see we have this down
1:38:14
below in that description super super important again you can see the green check mark this worked properly and we
1:38:19
have one item that is passed at the very end you have this plus icon to add in that next node and it populates this
1:38:25
screen over there and guys that is going to be our section number three we've
1:38:32
covered a lot we covered the basics of triggers We covered the basics of some
1:38:37
of these different nodes. Showed you how to the data flows. I showed you how to pin data, modify the data as well. We
1:38:44
talked about expressions. We talked about different types uh whether SCA table or JSON an error and we built our
1:38:51
first workflow together. So really really happy about that. Uh next thing we're going to be covering is the most
1:38:58
common ways to build out a workflow with uh triggers. So, we're going to cover a
1:39:03
few different triggers like the manual schedule chat form and much more in that
1:39:09
next video. Keep up the great work and I will see you in section four. Now, well, congrats on building out your first
1:39:15
workflow. What we're going to do now is talk about other ways that you could start a workflow. There is well over 10
1:39:21
different options, but we're going to break it down into some of the first ones that are easier for beginners to
1:39:27
comprehend. And don't worry, we'll cover the other ones throughout this course. So that way you're familiar with all of
1:39:32
those. We're going to start with a blank canvas. And let's get started. Okay. So the first one that we should talk about
1:39:38
is our manual trigger. That is what used quite a lot already. And I can just go
1:39:44
over here and search manual trigger. Again, we have this icon over here. And we have the rounded corner. It says the
1:39:50
execute workflow. I use the manual trigger all the time for testing purposes. It's great because you can
1:39:56
just click this and then everything else starts running. Um, not much honestly to it. So, we're going to just fly through
1:40:03
it. The next one, which we're going to do, which I often pair with the manual trigger, is going to be a schedule. So,
1:40:10
we can go over here, add another trigger, and then we can say on a schedule. And we're going to actually jump in a little bit more detail on the
1:40:17
side of it. And why I use on a schedule with execute workflow. Well, in reality,
1:40:23
sometimes you want to run a workflow once at any given time and sometimes you want to run it on a specific schedule.
1:40:30
And what's nice is you can actually pair multiple triggers together. So imagine I have a workflow and our first node in it
1:40:37
is the edit set fields. Now, it's not always the case. Either one of these can technically start the workflow, whether
1:40:44
it's execution over here manually or if it's on a specific schedule. So like
1:40:50
let's say every day at midnight, right? You can run this and every day at midnight it runs it. Or if you're testing there, you can run this over
1:40:56
here or if you want to do whatever you want. So one of the things that people don't understand is you can have multiple triggers start a specific
1:41:03
workflow. And that's just, you know, one of the different use cases over here. Uh jumping into the schedule trigger,
1:41:09
you'll see we have different trigger intervals. You can go all the way to seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks,
1:41:14
months, or a custom cron job. And the thing with cron jobs, it's quite complicated. In fact, you can see it has
1:41:21
this format over here. And I would recommend if you want to learn a little bit more about cron jobs, you check out
1:41:27
our video that we have already based around it. Um, we have a full trigger video talking about that side of it. And
1:41:32
honestly, it's a little bit outside the scope because I don't you you will need it in some sort of cases, but it's not
1:41:39
used as often as you think. um just based off of what's already available here directly in any and if this wasn't
1:41:45
a drop down and you just had cron jobs I would recommend learning about it but you can see minutes between triggers you
1:41:51
can set this up as well so you can see like 5 minutes or you can go over here in hours 1 hour trigger at a minute days
1:41:58
you have different options as well and you have other rules as well so um why I mentioned like the crown job is nice to
1:42:04
have but like you can set up different rules over here and have multiple rules like maybe you have one on a specific
1:42:09
day and you have one on a specific month. Um, so for example, let's say you have a report that needs to be sent out
1:42:16
once a month, but then also every Friday. You can build that out off of these specific rules over here. But set
1:42:24
them up. You can set up a specific time with the schedule trigger or you could
1:42:29
set up something automatically. And both of these populate this over here. Okay, the next one is a chat trigger. So, I'm
1:42:37
just going to delete this edit. And what we'll do is go into our chat. So,
1:42:43
actually, you know what? I'll keep these here. We'll go into chat and we'll do something else. So, go into chat.
1:42:51
And chat trigger is used a lot more than in the past because of chatub because
1:42:57
ideally you can start your workflow from this in chatub. But this is kind of like
1:43:02
a chatbot and you can open up the chat and you can send a message. You can say hi, right? And it starts this and the
1:43:09
first item past it in here. And you can see action send message chat input is
1:43:14
hi. And it's really common to have some sort of AI node directly after a chat
1:43:21
message. And the most common one is going to be your AI agent. So if you go in your AI agent, and again, we're not
1:43:27
covering AI agents in this section. We're actually going to cover it into the next one. Uh but you can see connected chat trigger node is the
1:43:33
source for the prompt. You can either define it below or the chat trigger node. It's just so common to use it. And
1:43:39
you can see prompt user message is JSON.put. Literally, this is one of the most common use cases for chat message
1:43:45
received and any is used to it. And that's why they built this in. It's so nice. You don't have to paste in this
1:43:51
chat input and it's just set by default. And you can see right over here, parameter text has expression. You can
1:43:58
open this up and you can't update this because it automatically pulls whatever is in that chat into that specific AI
1:44:05
agent. And you don't always have to go directly an AI agent. Again, you can use other approaches for your workflows, but
1:44:12
it's just very very common uh to have that there. Okay. So, another thing with chat, you can see uh we have this over
1:44:19
here. There's been no response from our AI agent. So, what I want to do is actually just add a chat model really
1:44:24
quick. And we're just going to ask it a very basic question. So, I'm going to go over here.
1:44:31
We'll go over in GPT5 Mini. I got to go to my other account. And don't worry, we're going to talk about credentials a
1:44:36
bit. Uh we'll just go to GPT 5 minutes since it's cheap. And we'll ask the
1:44:42
question, who won the World Series
1:44:47
in 1972 and it's going to go in our AI agent. It runs. And by the way, another thing you
1:44:54
mentioned is you see how it added that animation that determines like, hey, this note is currently running. I don't
1:44:59
think we covered that. Um but you can see the Oakland Athletics won 1972 World Series. given the Cincinnati Reds four games to three. MVP was Jean Tennis,
1:45:07
which I don't know who Gene Tennis is, and I probably mispronounced it, but um yeah, that's the chat trigger. Very,
1:45:13
very common to set this up with an AI agent. You can see we have our chat window over here, which again, we can
1:45:19
expand. We can also expand it this way if we want. We have our logs over here.
1:45:26
You can clear your logs. You have your model. It tells you how many tokens. You have your output. A lot more other kind of more advanced. And uh we're just
1:45:32
gonna hide the chat and we're going to move on to our next one. So the next one we're going to specifically use is a
1:45:37
form. And another one that I just use all the time. And you can go to the Nan form and you'll see trigger and it says
1:45:45
on a new N form opinion. Now you have two different URLs for your form. We're
1:45:50
not going to really talk too much about production as of yet. Uh but just jumping in over here, you'll see we have
1:45:56
our test URL and we have our production URL. And you also have authentication with your form. We're going to cover
1:46:02
authentication in a whole section, but you can set your title for the form. So feel free to set title as you want. I'm
1:46:08
just going to say nan starter form. And then you can set a form description.
1:46:15
So we'll say take user input. And what's really cool is there's a lot of
1:46:20
different form elements. So if we go over here, you'll see we add a form element. And then first thing you do is
1:46:26
set a field name. This could be fixed or an expression but you can say okay let's say person name person name
1:46:36
and then you can say label what is your name next you have your element type so
1:46:42
you could specify if hey is this a checkbox you can adding custom HTML is
1:46:47
this a date is this a dropown email file a hidden field a number password radio
1:46:52
buttons text or text area you know out of all these the most common ones you're going to use checkbox boxes quite a bit.
1:46:58
You're going to use dates a lot, drop downs, super super popular, numbers, also very popular, radio buttons, text
1:47:04
and text area. So, uh you can also put placeholder values and as well as a
1:47:09
default value. Um again, depends on your use case, but your placeholder would
1:47:15
just kind of show you what's there and what the default value if something isn't there. You also have your required field. So, sometimes people won't fill
1:47:21
out a form and hey, I actually need this data point. So you can just turn this on or turn this off. And you have different
1:47:28
options when uh the form is submitted or workflow finishes. Most of the time I just use form is submitted. In addition,
1:47:33
you can add in multiple form elements. You can see how I'm just adding in all these,
1:47:39
but we'll just go very basic and we'll use the person's name. In addition, you have other options down below. You can
1:47:45
append any attribution labels, paths, you can ignore bots. This is helpful
1:47:50
when you're in production. Uh you can use the time time zone of the workflow which we've already showed you set this
1:47:56
up and you can do custom styling which is just over here and you can change different fonts. You can change all the
1:48:03
colors associated with it. So if you want to change the design on the form I would just recommend you send it to an
1:48:09
LLM. I'll show you how we can do this here in a second. But let's just execute step to show you what this form looks
1:48:15
like. So I'll execute the step and you can see it says any n starter form take user input. I put my name over here.
1:48:22
Let's say Ryan Nolan submit. And then you can see over here it says person name submitted at the
1:48:28
exact time stamp and then form mode test. So you can see we're in our our test URL. So if I click the copy of this
1:48:34
form URL and I put this over here,
1:48:44
you can see that this says form trigger isn't listening yet. But if I go over here to execute step
1:48:51
or if I go over here, refresh this, you'll see that this is available and it
1:48:57
says this is a test version of your form. And uh again, be very careful with your form. I'm just going to stop the
1:49:03
execution over here, which by the way, I didn't even really talk about this, but you can execute your workflow from down
1:49:08
over here. You can see chat as an option here, too. But be very careful with that production URL. So that is an option
1:49:16
over there. That was just text. We can go and take a look at a few other ones and do checkboxes. Let's do a drop down
1:49:23
and we'll say instead of person name, oh actually let's go and do the name and
1:49:28
what we'll do instead is we'll have another section and we'll say N
1:49:34
skill level. We'll say what is your N skill level?
1:49:44
And what we can do is go down over here. Let's do something like a dropown default value. We're going to say
1:49:49
beginner. So option beginner their option over here. Advanced.
1:49:57
Obviously like you could add in a lot of different things over here. But we'll just do this to save some time. And you
1:50:03
can see this just as a drop down over there. We'll stop listening. And you can
1:50:08
say I didn't want to add option but I want to add another form. Uh field name used
1:50:15
N before. Have you used N before? And we can go
1:50:24
over here. Element type. Let's use a checkbox. Default value. Let's say we're
1:50:30
going to actually fill this out this time. We're going to say yes. Go over here and say yes as a label. Add a
1:50:36
checkbox. And then, you know, then you can limit selection. Um, and you can set
1:50:41
stuff like that, too. Anyways, we'll go execute step. I've used an end before.
1:50:46
This allows both of these. Obviously, that's not correct. So, you could stop listening. You could set exact number.
1:50:53
You could set one over here. And if you go to exact step this time, it says you must submit exactly one option. So, you
1:51:00
can't choose both. And this is forcing you to choose one option. So you can go over here, put Ryan, and you can really
1:51:08
see how we can build this out. So here's what I want you guys to do just get used to stuff. And obviously there's more
1:51:15
triggers, but I want to give you guys an assignment again just to kind of build this out. I want you to take a form. So
1:51:23
we're going to say step one, like we're going to build out an AN
1:51:28
form. little anyn form that asks
1:51:33
about job. So what this might have questions
1:51:39
is like one is like job title,
1:51:44
two is a job description, three
1:51:50
join date or the job and I put data over here but let's say join date. Um, what
1:51:57
else can we throw in over here really quick? And I want you to go over here and add in different form elements for
1:52:03
these. So like try different form elements. What else can we just throw in
1:52:09
over here really fast? So we put the title, description. I know there's other things that we could put over here as well, but I'm
1:52:16
just going to go over here and take out how to form elements. We're not going to cover files. Oh, um,
1:52:24
we could put over here. I'm just going to say four fake work email. Don't put in your exact email for this demo, but I
1:52:31
think that'd be another good ad on here. I'm just trying to get you guys to use different things, right? Um, what else
1:52:37
can we add in over here? Text, drop down, number, password.
1:52:43
I have a number in here. Uh, might be the last thing. Title, description. Oh, yeah. Put
1:52:50
salary. Salary. Cool. So, what I want you to do is pause this video, build out a form
1:52:57
based around this, and uh yeah, we'll take a look at that output. We'll throw
1:53:03
all this also into an edit set field right after. And let's put this over here. Add edit set field after this. And
1:53:14
I know we haven't really talked about that in greater detail as of yet, but I want you to pause the video, do this,
1:53:20
and I'll cover the solution, and then after what we'll do next is talk about
1:53:25
the styling of the form. All right, ready? Pause the video. 3 2 1, try it out, and I will be right back.
1:53:32
All right, I am back. Let's build out this form. So, we'll go and go and grab
1:53:38
the form, the nan form, and we'll say on a new form event, and let's build this
1:53:44
out. So, the first thing we want to do is grab our job title. So, this is pretty easy. We'll say job form
1:53:52
um job form for nan video. I guess it's more of a course than that. We'll add an
1:53:58
element field name. We'll say job name. What is your job title?
1:54:07
No, it's just like we'll do job name like this. That's fine. This is text.
1:54:13
Again, you can make things required or not, but I'm not going to do that. Next, we're going to go into our job
1:54:19
description. We'll just call this job description label job description as well. We'll
1:54:26
call this over here instead of text a text area. So that way someone can fill out a little bit more information. The
1:54:31
next is join date for job or job start date. Again, I could really fix this and
1:54:37
make it better, but I don't think it really matters too much for a tutorial. Obviously, if you're building things for
1:54:42
customers, be as detailed as possible. Um, all right. So, this time we're going to grab a date over here. And it says
1:54:49
the display date is formatted based on local of the user's browser. Right? Fake
1:54:54
work email. Go over here and add in work email.
1:55:01
And uh we'll just grab that. We'll go over here and grab email this time. And then lastly, let's grab our salary. So
1:55:08
just going back in over here, add form element. Put in field name as a salary
1:55:13
label. This time we're going to go into a number. And yeah, so we have everything over here. Obviously, I I've
1:55:19
kind of rushed through this. Hopefully you take your time and you can execute the step. And you can see we have a full
1:55:24
form now. We have this calendar. We have a work email that expects an email. So
1:55:30
you can see it says enter a valid email address. I have a salary. So if I type in this like it's not letting me um but
1:55:37
if I type in number that's fine over here. This expands out. So you can see that expanding out over here. Whereas
1:55:42
this does not. And if I put this over here I'll say data scientist
1:55:49
job description but underwriting and risk. It's my full-time job. Job doing date is
1:55:56
way in the past. Work email, we're just going to say ryangoogle.com.
1:56:02
Now, obviously, I don't work at Google, but I'm just going to put that over here. And salary, we're just going to add in this over here. I do make way
1:56:09
more than that, but uh we'll click submit. And you'll see we have all this information over here. And what's great
1:56:14
is we can pass all this data into our edit set field. And you can take a look
1:56:19
at this. And we can actually just grab and drag and drop
1:56:25
all of our data points directly into edit set and we're going to learn a lot more about this here in a second. Um you
1:56:31
can even see we grab the submitted at which wasn't in the form. You can execute step and take a look. We have
1:56:37
all that on that side of things. Great. Okay. One other thing I did promise you guys is just showing you how we can
1:56:44
update this form. And let me just stop this really fast.
1:56:49
This not run. I guess some weird stuff. Let me save this. I'll refresh it and uh we'll just
1:56:56
change the formatting really quick of this form.
1:57:03
I guess I never Oh, I never filled this out. That's why. It's like why did it not allow me to do that? That's all
1:57:09
right. We'll save it and let's add in the colors now. So, just to grab this,
1:57:16
I'm going to go and put Claude up. So, we're going to go Claude AI.
1:57:21
throw this in over here. And what I'm going to do is just grab this form. We
1:57:27
have this. And I'm going to grab all this code and then say,
1:57:33
can you change this code? So the form is red and blue. Super
1:57:41
simple. And I'm just going to throw this over here. Obviously, there's a lot of things
1:57:46
that you could change, but it's going to go over here,
1:57:53
make those changes for you. And you can see key changes applied.
1:57:58
Just copy that. And this is something you'll learn over time is like you can prompt large language models to help you
1:58:06
solve things faster because take a look at that form. We completely changed it. It took us two seconds. And in the past,
1:58:13
historically, we would have to know our colors. We would have to change this up. I could have provided exact colors as
1:58:18
well to our LM or ideas of a form like a design. But at the end of the day, this
1:58:24
took two seconds for a YouTube video. And uh yeah, I'm pretty happy with it. I'm curious if I click submit. That's
1:58:30
pretty cool. All right, so I'm going to close out of that. We're going to save this. And we're just going to recap this
1:58:36
video before we move into our next section, which by the way, our next section we're actually going to learn about using an AI agent, which I'm super
1:58:43
thrilled uh to get over there. I know obviously there's still so much to learn, but I want to get you using AI.
1:58:49
Regardless, first you can use multiple triggers uh to start a workflow. Very common one is manual execution with a
1:58:56
schedule trigger. Schedule trigger is for timing in real world, especially
1:59:01
like for my job, I do data analysis. I have reports getting sent out every day, sometimes every week, sometimes every
1:59:07
month. So, schedule trigger helps with your workflows on that side of things. You have a chat message received, very
1:59:13
common to use with an AI agent. Also, using a chat message received, um you'll need that for specifically ChatHub to
1:59:20
start a workflow. So, you'll see these being used way more in workflows just based off of ChatHub and how awesome it
1:59:26
is. Uh, and form. I use forms a lot for when I want to process binary data or I
1:59:31
want to grab a lot of different inputs from a specific user. And we covered a lot of different examples of what you
1:59:37
could throw into a form. And uh, yeah, for testing, I'm just using the testing URL. I'm not even going to cover
1:59:43
production URL until we're a little bit later in the video. Probably talking about web hooks when we talk about production URL. So, don't worry about
1:59:49
that over now. Um, but one of the benefits of this form is we get in our data and then it already has one item
1:59:54
and we can start passing it forward. Lastly, I showed you how we could change the colors on the form. And remember, there's other triggers out there. We're
2:00:01
just covering the basics in this particular video. But now, we're going to cover AI agents, and I will see you
2:00:07
shortly in section five. So, in this section, I want to get you guys some of your first wins using an AI agent.
2:00:14
Obviously, there's a lot of details with AI agents, and we're going to go into a little bit more of an advanced section
2:00:19
quite later in this course, but the goal and objective of this section is to
2:00:24
learn how to set up a AI agent with LMS from a few different popular providers. I'm going to show you how to set up Open
2:00:31
AI. I'm going to show you how to do Cloud Enthropic as well as Google. We're also going to go through two exercises
2:00:37
together uh to get used to this as well. And yeah, let's jump right into it. So,
2:00:43
the first thing we're going to do is go over and just set up a chat trigger. Now, you should be somewhat familiar
2:00:48
with this based off of the last two videos. So, we're going to have a chat trigger over here. And then what we're
2:00:54
going to do next is go and grab a AI agent. So, we'll go over here, have our
2:00:59
AI agent, and by default, it'll have the chat trigger go into the AI agent. Again, we've covered this before where
2:01:06
the prompt for the chat should say JSON.put. It already does. So, we're pretty good
2:01:11
to go on that side of things. But now, what we need to do is fill out our property where it says chat model. And
2:01:19
this is really important because this defines what model you're going to be working with. If you don't have this,
2:01:24
nothing's going to happen. And just to show you, I'll put over here um I don't know, we'll say what is the most
2:01:33
expensive Babe Ruth baseball card. And I I might be misspelling this over here. My
2:01:40
microphone is in the way, but you'll see we'll get an error because it says a
2:01:45
chat sub node must be connected enabled. And we just don't have our chat model. So it's super important to set this up.
2:01:52
So let's click on this plus icon and you'll see over here we have all of our different language models we can work
2:01:58
with. You have cloud andropic over here. You have Azure, AWS, go here, Deep Seek,
2:02:04
Google Gemini, Vert.Ex, Grock, Mistral, Lemonade, Olama, Open Router, Grock,
2:02:10
Open AI, and there's just so many and you're like, man, I I don't know what to use. So, a few notes like obviously the
2:02:17
most popular one out there, and this may change in the future, but as of
2:02:22
essentially 2026, I'm recording late December, OpenAI is probably used by the
2:02:27
most amount of users. Okay? So you'll see a lot of different workflows that use OpenAI. It's pretty popular in
2:02:34
corporate environments. But some of the other ones that are really really popular, you have Google Gemini, which
2:02:40
uh Gemini 3 has really taken off and put Gemini a little bit higher up in the rankings. And then you also have Cloud
2:02:47
Enthropic that a lot of people like as well. There is some local models over here which I'm not going to dive into.
2:02:54
You also have specifically open router which allows you to choose between different models. And then in addition,
2:03:01
you have things like grock um which may be helpful if you want to use specific Twitter data. You also have something
2:03:07
over here called the model selector. And it says use this node to select one or more of the connected say node based on the workflow data. Outside the scope of
2:03:14
today's video, but yeah, we're going to go through and set up multiple of these.
2:03:20
Let's start off with OpenAI. So, I'll just go over here and click open AI chat model. And the first thing you want to
2:03:26
do is set up an account. So, I'm going to show you how to create a new credential right now. We're going to click this. And you get this popup
2:03:33
screen and it says, "Need help filling out these fields? Open Docs." Again, any is fantastic for documentation, but
2:03:39
honestly, this is going to be pretty easy. All we need to do is get an API key. So, how do you get an API key?
2:03:44
Well, you go to a website, openai.com/api, and we're just going to log in over
2:03:49
here. If you don't have a account, make sure to set one up. But we're going to go login and we're going to go to API
2:03:55
platform. I'm just going to log in with my Google account. Cool. And then we're right over here. We're going to click
2:04:01
this settings icon. We're going to go into API keys. And then you're going to
2:04:06
create a new secret key. So just click plus create new secret key. Whatever
2:04:12
we're going to say. We're going to say N tutorial
2:04:17
full course. I don't know. We're going to delete these shortly after. You can set a project if you want. You can set
2:04:24
up specific permissions if you want. I'm just going to say a default project. I'm going to create the new secret key. And
2:04:29
then you see I have a key over here. So it says save your key. Please save your secret key is safe. So we won't be able
2:04:35
to view it again. Blah blah blah. Right? Best practices. Also to mention with API
2:04:40
keys, you can set limits in a in a platform. So just in case it gets lost or anything like that, but you only can
2:04:48
copy this once. So, copy that key and then go back into your API key over here. You'll see it's been pasted. If
2:04:53
you click save, then it'll say credential created inside your own personal workspace. And what I would
2:04:58
recommend is you actually label your credential over here. Uh because if you don't, you'll be confused like what's
2:05:05
account one, what's account two, what's account three. I made that mistake a long time ago and I just never cleaned
2:05:10
it up on here. So, just label this right away. If you want to delete your credential, you can go over here and delete it. I'm going to delete this one
2:05:16
because I don't want to use it. So, I'm going to say delete. Obviously, you see what this credential is. It's going to
2:05:21
be gone. And go over here, and I'm actually going to delete this one as
2:05:26
well. So, I'm going to remove that key so that way you guys can't use it. And we are good to go. So, I'm going to go
2:05:32
to my OpenAI account. And what you'll see next is we have different models over here. Now, I think one of the
2:05:38
things that N should improve on is just changing out the recent model that populates here. It's 41. I'm not using
2:05:45
41 at all. And by the time you watch this video, we might be on like GPT6 or GPT7. Um, but GPT52 is out, so you could
2:05:52
use that. I tend to use just mini because it's a cheaper model in a lot of my videos. So, I'll say GPT5 mini. You
2:05:59
also have the responses API, which has a lot of information outside the scope of this video. But just like that, like 5
2:06:07
minutes, we were able to set up this OpenAI chat model. Now, I'm going to save this over here. And I'm also going
2:06:13
to show you something pretty cool that we haven't covered yet in this course. And actually, it kind of escaped me when
2:06:19
I was covering the nodes and stuff like that. One of the things that you should be able to do as well is turn on and off nodes. So, if you see this over here,
2:06:26
I'm just going to deactivate it. And this is no longer being used. Now, obviously, this is a a chat model
2:06:32
attached to an AI agent, but the same thing happens with nodes. So, you can see it's deactivated or not. Um, outside
2:06:38
the scope of this particular lecture, but feel like that's important. So that's OpenAI. Next, what I want to have
2:06:45
us to set up is going to be Cloud Enthropic. So again, we're going to just click this chat model and I'm going to
2:06:51
go to anthropic chat model like this. What I'm going to do is click down over here and create new credential. So once
2:06:58
again, we have to get an API key. So if we go to claude console, so platform.cloud.com,
2:07:04
sign in with your Google account, which I'm going to do right now. Yep. Then you have this main screen over here. Make sure to get API key. We're going to
2:07:11
create a key and then name your key. I'll say n live tutorial.
2:07:19
I'll add this key. And again, you'll see our key right over here. Probably be
2:07:24
blurred out for this video, but go over here to API key, paste that in, and
2:07:29
you'll see save again. Rename your thing. And it says connection tested successfully if it works. I'm just going
2:07:35
to delete this one because we don't need that. And I'm going to go back over here and this as well. So just going to go
2:07:43
over here and delete this. Obviously you guys should not do that for your keys. I'm just doing
2:07:49
this right now because it's for the video. So it's been disabled. And delete it.
2:07:55
Great. So have both of those particularly in here. And again you have
2:08:00
a lot of different models associated with Claude. You can go over here. You can see Sonnet 45 I use quite a bit.
2:08:06
Opus 45 is a really expensive model. And maybe we'll have a section talking about like what model to use and what
2:08:12
particular use cases, but again, I'm just trying to get you set up and going. So that's Enthropic. I'm going to just
2:08:19
remove that over here and then deactivate it. Next, what we're going to work on is adding in Gemini. So click
2:08:26
this plus icon. You'll notice Google has multiple models. I'm going to use Gemini over here. And uh again, we're going to
2:08:32
just create a new account. So just click over here, create new credential. It's going to ask for an API key. So how you
2:08:39
get this is you go to Google AI studio. So AI studio.google.com.
2:08:44
And then uh we're going to just can go and get API key in the bottom left. Create new API key. I'm going to say
2:08:52
n course like this. You choose a cloud project as well if you want. And uh you
2:08:58
choose a cloud project as well. I'm just going to say any nut. We grab that.
2:09:04
And then we have our key. And again, you can just copy over the key. You can see copy API key like this. And uh yeah,
2:09:13
this one was here. So, copy that. Go back in over to Nan API key. You can
2:09:20
save that. And if it works, connection tested successfully. One thing to mention as well, and again, I'm just
2:09:25
going to delete this key because I don't need it.
2:09:31
One thing to mention as well though is you need to fund all of your accounts because these are paid. Now it you do
2:09:39
not use a lot of money with large language models if you're doing a small
2:09:44
amount of testing. Like there's it's very rarely like I spend more than $50 a month on projects just for YouTube
2:09:51
tutorials and things like that and testing and building out things. Obviously if you have a SAS product or you're selling services that's going to
2:09:57
be a little bit different. Um, but just keep that in mind. These models tend to be pretty cheap. There is expensive
2:10:03
models out there as well. Uh, for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini. So
2:10:08
like Gemini over here, we can go over and choose a specific model. I'm using Gemini 3 for a lot of stuff. So this pro
2:10:15
preview over here. And yeah, we'll talk about cost of models and a lot more in
2:10:20
our advanced section. This is just our basics. So what I want us to do now is build out a workflow. We're going to use
2:10:27
our chat trigger. We're going to use our AI agent over here. And then um let's ask each of these over here a question.
2:10:34
What we're going to ask is and I'll put this over here. What is the most
2:10:40
important any end skill? So we're going to ask each model that.
2:10:46
Let's jump through this. So first I'm going to unactivate these or make them
2:10:52
live I should say and we'll test them one at a time. So, let's open up our chat. I'm going to
2:10:59
clear the chat log. So, I just click reset chat session like that. And let's jump into it. So, our first one, what is
2:11:06
the most important N skill? And I'm actually very curious what each of these say. So, our first one's going to be
2:11:11
open AI. And I just want to document this, too.
2:11:16
Uh, we're going to use Claude and then we're going to use All right.
2:11:23
So short answer the single most important N skill is knowing how to work with data and APIs reading
2:11:29
and transforming JSON HTTP between systems debug inflow again my mic is like right here and that's in the bottom
2:11:36
left so it's kind of tough to read so we'll just copy this obviously they
2:11:41
wrote a lot over here you can see that is our answer I don't know why I'm copying this here it
2:11:47
doesn't matter so now what I'll do is I'll just deactivate this or move this out of the way and I will throw in
2:11:54
anthropic. Cool. Let's run this again. So, I'm just going to go reset chat session. And uh
2:12:01
we'll go through on this side of things. And what you'll notice as well, each of
2:12:07
these models have their own personality. Like they respond short, fast, efficiently.
2:12:12
And there's a there's a lot of nuances behind it, but you're getting the ground started. And you can see there's a ton.
2:12:19
Understanding logic flow and conditional thinking is the most important N skill. Interesting.
2:12:26
And then uh we'll go into Gemini next.
2:12:31
Again, we'll just clear this out. Ask the same question. You'll see we get three different
2:12:38
results. All right. And then it says, "If you had to pick just one skill that separates an
2:12:44
average and end user from an expert, it is data transformations using JavaScript." I don't think that's the
2:12:50
most important skill. Um, low code and etc. So, three different
2:12:56
results, three different models. There you go. So, I'm just going to hide the chat right now. And what I want you guys
2:13:04
to do is work on a mini project for this section. So, let's outline your small
2:13:09
project. Again, we're keeping things simple. It's going to get a little bit more complicated towards the end, but
2:13:17
let's jump into it. So, large language models are pretty good at researching.
2:13:22
And one of the things I want you to do, see if you share a birthday with someone that is famous. So, how are we going to
2:13:28
do this? Well, step one, what we need to do is have a form trigger. Form trigger.
2:13:35
And what this does is this accepts
2:13:40
a uh date or a birthday.
2:13:45
Then step two is we're going to send the information
2:13:51
into an AI agent. And then step three, we're going to ask
2:13:57
the agent, do I share the same
2:14:04
birthday? We'll say day and month
2:14:10
as someone famous. And then part four,
2:14:16
we're going to also expand on this and we're going to say this should be within
2:14:25
I guess like industries or something like that. Um
2:14:30
these let's say music genres. Sorry, this one makes more sense. these music genres
2:14:38
or and we're gonna say sports.
2:14:43
Okay, so let me explain what we're going to do on this one a little bit better.
2:14:48
Famous birthday matcher. So here's how this works. We're going to
2:14:55
set a form as a trigger. And this should accept the date for a birthday
2:15:01
music genre like that as well as favorite
2:15:08
sports. So it could be one or more for music genres, one or more for favorite sports
2:15:14
a date as a birthday. Then what we're going to do is send that information into an AI agent like this. Then we're
2:15:21
going to ask the agent. So, we're going to ask it. We're going to open this up over here. Instead of a chat trigger,
2:15:27
we're going to define below. We're going to ask the agent, do I share the birthday with someone famous? And then
2:15:33
this should be within these music genres or sports. Again, you could have one or more for each of these. So, lot going
2:15:40
on, but I think you could do it based off of everything we've covered so far. Pause the video and uh attempt to do
2:15:47
this. I'm going to pause it in three, two, one. Go for it. and uh come back
2:15:53
once this is ready to go. All right, we are back. Let's try it. So, first thing we're going to do is set
2:15:59
up our form trigger. So, you go to any end form and we're going to say on a new form event and this is our form. So,
2:16:06
let's first ask our specific questions and we're going to say birthday matcher is the name. Again, you can use whatever
2:16:13
you want. Matcher, we'll say matches famous birthdays.
2:16:20
And let's we have to have three form elements. So the first one is going to say birthday
2:16:26
and label. We're going to go over here and it say birthday
2:16:33
or we should put like your birthday or something like that. Birthday.
2:16:38
Then what we're going to specifically do is go over here and look for a date.
2:16:44
That is a required field. Then we're going to have another form element. We're gonna say music genres,
2:16:55
favorite styles of music. And you know, this could be
2:17:01
multiple things if you want it to be. Um, you know, you could have kind of a drop down if you already have defined
2:17:07
genres. You could also choose uh checkboxes. You could also technically
2:17:14
go over here and choose radio buttons, but I'm just going to keep this as just simple text like that.
2:17:22
Yep. And then we're going to do is have sports.
2:17:28
Sports. And I'm just going to say um favorite sports.
2:17:34
And a lot of options that you can choose if you want to customize this to your liking. We already covered this a little bit in the last video. Then what we're
2:17:41
going to do is we're going to create an AI agent. So go over here to AI agents and we'll grab that and you'll see we
2:17:49
have this over here. However, this won't work right away. So what we need to do is define below and we'll write this
2:17:55
here in a second. But we need to add in our chat model. I'm going to be lazy and I'm just going to use Google Gemini. So
2:18:02
just copy that and then paste it. Uh so crV works really well in nan. So, we
2:18:10
already have this set up with my credentials. And what we're going to do now is test
2:18:17
this form out. So, I'm actually going to disconnect this really fast and we're going to test the form out. So, execute
2:18:24
step your birthday. So, put in your birth date over here. I'm just going to
2:18:31
use today's date, but obviously uh way back. So, let's go.
2:18:39
I'll say like 1990 December 26. Today is not my birthday, by the way. Favorite
2:18:45
style of music. You know, I like rock, metal,
2:18:52
some bluegrass. I like And favorite sports. We're going to say baseball,
2:18:59
running, we'll put cricket in here. Um, I think that should be fine. So, we'll say submit. And you'll see we have our
2:19:07
data that is over here. We can pin this if we want. We could change this data,
2:19:12
but I'm just going to pin it for now. And then we're going to go and attach our AI agent. And we're going to say uh
2:19:20
create a prompt. Now, I haven't taught you anything about writing good prompts, but that's okay. Uh, we're going to say
2:19:27
what birthday what famous people have a
2:19:33
birthday on this month
2:19:39
and day. We're going to go over here and then pass in this birthday.
2:19:46
So, you can see it turned into an expression. I'm also going to expand this out. So, if you click this bottom
2:19:51
icon, it expands it out. And let's write this out.
2:19:57
The famous person or famous people
2:20:03
must play in this sport
2:20:09
in these sports I should say and obviously my grammar is not perfect today but I'm writing this on the on the
2:20:16
spot or they are a musician
2:20:23
and and play this style of music.
2:20:31
Production-wise prompts, there's a lot that I would change over here, but all we're asking the AI is what famous
2:20:39
people what famous people have a birthday on this month and day. So, we pass in the birthday from the form. The
2:20:44
famous people must play in these sports like that. And the musician play in this
2:20:51
style in these styles
2:20:57
of music and then you can pass in multiple genres. And you can see over here to the right the result the birth
2:21:02
date baseball running cricket rock middle. So now save that and let's test
2:21:10
out this workflow. Obviously I've pinned this data so I don't run the form again. And now I'm very curious what results
2:21:16
we're going to get. We didn't even define what type of output we want from the AI agent. We can specify that in
2:21:22
multiple ways, but we're just we're getting our feet wet right now. We're
2:21:27
only on section five and there's a lot more to cover. And you'll see we have a results. So we can go over here based on
2:21:35
the specific date of December 26, 1990 and your required categories. There's one prominent famous person who fits at
2:21:42
cretire criteria and I can't say it. Andy Biserk, founder and lead vocalist of the
2:21:49
metal of the band Blackville Brides plays rock, metal. Well, there other
2:21:55
famous people in this day such as soccer player Ramsey. They do not fit the sport or music genres you requested. That's
2:22:01
pretty cool. Now, what we could do as well is let's change this up and I'll
2:22:06
click this over here and let's make it tomorrow's date 1227. So, I'll save that
2:22:12
and we will run this again and you'll see we're going to get different results. We're going to get probably
2:22:18
different text as well from Gemini just because we didn't really define our prompt that well. This is like a very
2:22:24
mediocre prompt. I would probably give it like a C minus, but you know, it is what it is. It's good for a tutorial.
2:22:32
Now I'm curious like who did you guys share a birthday with? Put that below in the comments section. Obviously this is
2:22:38
a very early project like a form submission AI agent and when you get further in the course you're like man
2:22:44
this was so basic. I wish everything was this basic but it's good to get some wins.
2:22:50
So we'll run this one more time and it'll take a little bit but that's fine.
2:22:55
Also show you a few other quick wins in here. And you can see over here there's a lot more stuff. So based on the
2:23:00
specific birth date and the strict categories provided there are no internationally renowned celebrities. However, there are professional athletes
2:23:07
in cricket category fit the exact description. Horus Miller a Jamaican cricketer which I didn't even know they
2:23:13
played uh cricket in Jamaica. All right. These are famous born on that
2:23:18
exact day. Professional tennis player, ice hockey player.
2:23:24
Yeah. So a lot more stuff going on on that side of things. So either way that
2:23:30
is essentially how we built this out. So one other
2:23:37
thing I really wanted to quickly show you is sometimes a large language model
2:23:42
will fail like a company is down or like that. So how do you actually build a backup and let me just show you this
2:23:48
over here because this takes like two seconds. You enable a fallback model. So imagine like
2:23:56
OpenAI is down but that's your primary driver. You could have a fallback model and let's say you want to have your
2:24:01
fallback model be Google Gemini. So this will get priority but if something's going on with OpenAI you have something
2:24:08
as a fallback and this is something I highly recommend that you do if you build out some sort of production grade
2:24:14
system or something that cannot fail. It literally takes two seconds to add a fallback model in over here and it's
2:24:19
just a really good thing to do. Obviously, we are going to have a lot of other things we talk about later, but
2:24:25
there is going to be that. So, hopefully you learned uh quite a bit in this
2:24:30
section. Our next section we're going to do is we're going to cover a lot more about data types as well as JSON. But
2:24:37
before we get into some technical stuff, I wanted to get you guys a win. We haven't even covered the the basic nodes
2:24:43
yet really outside of edit set and some of these triggers. And that'll be coming up in section number seven. Uh thanks
2:24:50
guys for watching so far and if you are getting a lot of value make sure to subscribe but yeah see you in section
2:24:57
six. So this next section is going to be a little bit more complicated than the previous ones and we're be focusing on
2:25:03
in particular is going to be data types. And data types is critical especially in
2:25:09
like software engineering or data analytics or anytime you're going to be doing some sort of programming because
2:25:14
if you don't have your correct data types you're going to have errors in your specific program. So we're going to
2:25:20
cover what any has available today. We'll go through a lot of different examples and then we're going to also
2:25:26
show you a little bit of insights as well as how JSON works with these particular data types. So let's jump
2:25:32
right into NN. Uh we're going to be on our section number six. And we're going
2:25:38
to keep this very basic. We'll have a manual trigger. And then what we're going to have next is just an edit set.
2:25:44
And the reason why is if you go over into the edit set and we're just going to put like example one. You can see
2:25:52
that we have different data in over here. We have something called a string. We have a number. We have a boolean
2:25:58
array object as well as binary data. So
2:26:03
we're going to go through each of these one at a time and kind of give you some examples with that. So what we're going
2:26:09
to do is say this is example string and a string is pretty straightforward.
2:26:15
All a string asks us to do is have text. So you could say for example um Trent
2:26:24
Resner, the lead singer of 9inch nails. You can go over here and you can see example string and it says Trent Resnal
2:26:32
which is pretty cool. And one of the other things with strings is you could technically have a number as a string as
2:26:38
well. So if you type in 99999 like this execute step and that is
2:26:45
perfectly valid and you could mix both these together. So I'll go over further
2:26:50
here like that and we'll run this example and you can see we have technically a number with a string but
2:26:57
this is all together as a string. It really doesn't matter and you can put special characters in over here as well.
2:27:04
I meant to press shift on my keyboard but this is totally valid as well. So
2:27:11
our next data type is a little bit more restrictive and this is going to be a number. So we'll call this example
2:27:18
number example number and you know it has zero
2:27:23
by default. Let's keep it. And you'll see over here in the output we actually have a difference as well. So I'm just
2:27:29
taking a look at the schema view. But you can see how this says T for like a string or text. Well, this one has a
2:27:35
number icon which is really nice from the Nan team because you can just look over here really quick and tell the different data types. If you go over to
2:27:42
your table, you you don't know for sure, but the schema will tell us that JSON,
2:27:47
it does tell us that that as well because you can see the string has double quotes, whereas the example
2:27:53
number, it does not. And again, just to show you the difference, if we remove
2:27:58
all that and just keep it as 9999 and we use the same thing for our number,
2:28:05
it does not have these double quotes, whereas the string does. So if you're in the JSON view and you see this
2:28:13
right string number. So where people get tripped up is you cannot put a string as
2:28:22
a number. So if I go over here and say print or I put anything in here. So you can
2:28:27
see it says E4. And it's actually pretty restrictive because I'm trying to spam my keyboard. I believe in the past you
2:28:33
could um but now they probably have some sort of logic based in there. Uh you can see example number is null. This just
2:28:40
generally does not work. It actually did not take that as input. Also in the past this used to specifically crash and it
2:28:47
would have an error. But it looks like now any end team just has this as particularly null which is I think a
2:28:54
pretty good ad over here. But again you cannot include anything else over here
2:28:59
minus a specific number. And uh yeah that's the difference. String you can
2:29:05
have a number in there. Number you can't. All right. So, what we have next over here is going to be a boolean. And
2:29:13
boolean is so simple. Either something is going to be true or it's going to be false. So, let's take a look at a true
2:29:19
example. We'll go over here and call this example boolean. So, example boolean like that. Okay. Now, we're
2:29:27
going to do example three and four. So, example three we're going to take a look at is our booleans in the array.
2:29:36
So, we're going to make sure we click onto array. And in over here, it will say true and false,
2:29:43
true and false. That you can see again, no double
2:29:50
quotes, but it grabs our example from the boolean. And lastly, let's combine everything together. Let's have an array
2:29:56
that has string, a boolean, and a number. So, go for that. We'll just copy
2:30:04
each of our records. that we've had so far each of our items inside these arrays. So,
2:30:10
pretty straightforward. So, if I say so myself
2:30:15
and we'll just go down here and choose array. You can see we just have a lot of
2:30:21
different data types inside of that particular array. Again, one thing to differentiate our
2:30:27
array from everything else. You can see we have these brackets here at the very end. So brackets like that, brackets
2:30:34
like that. And uh everything else doesn't, right? Our string doesn't have those brackets. Our number doesn't have
2:30:40
those. We have true or false directly in here. But when you have a string inside of array, you have to make sure that you
2:30:46
have these quotes. And I just put single quotes in over here. Numbers have none. And then true or false have none as
2:30:53
well. Okay. So now what we're going to do is we're going to take a look at something called an object. And because
2:31:00
I didn't want to make this pretty complicated, we're just going to say example object one. I actually had this
2:31:06
generated by Claude because it's kind of a pain to create an object.
2:31:13
Just grab an object over here for 9in nails. That's why I was given those examples. And uh I'll just paste this in
2:31:19
over here. Obviously, again, you could just make this way larger, but still even there. And you can see I can make
2:31:24
it like this. Feel like it's just easier explained. And if I execute the step, no issues.
2:31:31
You can see all this is populated over there. To take a look at the schema for example once again, we have our text for
2:31:38
string number. We have kind of a checkbox or boolean an array has these three lines. You can see that. And then
2:31:45
our object kind of has that specific cube. And inside of that, you can see we have a 9-in nails release, an album, a
2:31:52
track, production, and then additional metadata. This is quite complicated for
2:31:57
you right now. But because we're showing these other data types over here, it was pretty important to do that. Uh so you
2:32:04
can see Nails and we have other information inside of the album year label, the track, the production
2:32:11
associated with it as well as the metadata. One other thing that you're going to see in this edit set is
2:32:17
something called binary data. And what binary data is is any sort of file
2:32:22
within the NAN and it is also outside of the scope. I'm not going to be covering
2:32:28
binary data in this uh specific section. In fact, there's a full section we're going to dedicate towards binary data
2:32:34
because binary data is weird in N and it's something that trips up a lot of beginners. So do not want to cover
2:32:41
binary data within this JSON basic in data types. So the next thing I just want to quickly cover is like how do you
2:32:48
access specific parts uh in particular like with an array or an object because
2:32:53
you'll see this when you work with APIs or you're working with data. You might want to have a a specific section. So
2:33:00
what we're going to do is have another edit set and I'm just going to show you the JSON associated behind it. So all
2:33:06
you got to do and like obviously this is pretty easy is just grab a section. So
2:33:13
for example, if I'm grabbing this example array 4 and why is this not running?
2:33:20
Oh, you know why it's not running is I have this binary data that's complete garbage. All right, now now it's going
2:33:26
to run. I'm like, why is this not running? All right, so you'll see that I was able to populate this example of it
2:33:34
should be Trent, but it's tent. So I'm grabbing the array for and I'm grabbing the first element of it. And this also
2:33:40
trips up a lot of people initially. A lot of times in programming, you're going to start from zero. So zero is
2:33:46
going to be that first position. So the item over here within the array, the first one is zero, then goes one, two,
2:33:53
and it ends with n minus one, which is the number of items minus one. So if you have an array of three length, you start
2:33:59
with zero, you're then you have one and two, your last item will be the length minus one. Uh so just to go over here
2:34:06
and grab another example, you can see if we want to grab 75 that's over there. Um
2:34:12
again, you can just go here and take a look at the JSON as well for that specific object
2:34:18
and you'll see JSON.ample object tracktitle. So it goes example object
2:34:23
one, right, which is our JSON side of it. Then you dottrack, which is our next
2:34:29
part of it. And you grab the title section. So, a little bit more complicated JSON, but honestly, it's a
2:34:35
pretty easy because you can just drag and drop um based off of what expressions you have and everything like
2:34:41
that over here to the side. So, I typically kind of use the the schema view for this most of the time. Could
2:34:47
use the JSON view. I don't know why I've just kind of defaulted to schema over time. Each of these tell a different
2:34:52
story. Schema will give you just one example and the different data types behind it. table is really good when you're working with particular tabular
2:34:59
data which we haven't even really covered data tables and sheets and air table yet in this course but I use the
2:35:05
table view for that and then JSON as well gives you a lot of different examples so it can be really helpful to
2:35:10
see everything that is going on um again you can see data types JSON gives you
2:35:16
multiple examples table is really good for tabular data um I'm trying to think
2:35:21
anything else you can also grab like specific dates and times and things like that With JSON, there's a lot of
2:35:27
different shortcuts and things that you can combine together. Um, maybe I'll show you this really quick. You can also
2:35:34
have something, let's say we want to do full name. You can combine multiple together. So, what we might want to do
2:35:39
for the string is have this over here. And uh, we'll grab next side.
2:35:50
It's actually,
2:35:56
you can see I'm just putting both of these example arrays over here for Trent
2:36:01
Resner. And I just put a space in between that. You can also add with
2:36:06
math. So, for example, I'm just going to go over here and choose this as a number. Oops,
2:36:12
I accidentally deleted it. We'll do this as a number. So you can see it automatically changed
2:36:18
that to the number side of things. But I can go over here and say plus and then over here just going to grab
2:36:28
that and we'll put this over here. So when you're using strings and you want to combine them together, make sure that
2:36:33
you have these like double curly brackets on the outside. Put a space and then put that. But when you're adding
2:36:38
numbers together, you have to do this all with inside one curly bracket like this and just add them in between. And
2:36:46
you'll see we get 150 because we have 100 over here and then we're adding 50.
2:36:52
Run this one over here. We're getting tent reser. Um so first part is the tren or tent in this example then reser. So
2:36:59
space um you can also get now. So we'll say like time just go over here and say
2:37:08
and this should be an expression by the way. now like this
2:37:15
and you can see it gets the exact time stamp as a datetime right in over here.
2:37:20
So you can see we have all this together and uh yeah so what I'd say for your
2:37:27
example over here and we're not going to walk through it but really mess with these data types and uh put this over
2:37:34
here example to try is like example
2:37:41
create more data within edit set
2:37:48
create an array I'll say create an advanced array
2:37:57
with five elements and then grab specific pieces of information
2:38:06
of information with an edit set. I think that's probably going to be a
2:38:12
good example on the side of things. No need for me to kind of do this with you guys. I think it's pretty
2:38:18
self-explanatory how to do it, but really get these data types down because it's going to help you a lot even
2:38:24
outside of nan. All right, so now that's pretty much the end of this specific
2:38:30
lecture. We're going to jump into some more of the basic nodes um kind of like
2:38:35
added set things that you're going to use in almost every workflow or a good amount of those next. So we'll take a
2:38:41
look at like if as well as filter, switch, merge, and much more. I I believe it's going to be a bit of a
2:38:47
lengthier section. So before we jump in there, obviously make sure you're all set, you have some water, you have some
2:38:52
snacks, and uh you're eager to learn because it's going to be quite a long section. So I will see you guys right
2:38:59
there and keep up the awesome work. Okay, so we've covered a decent amount so far in this course and I think it's
2:39:05
time to cover some of the most essential nodes that you need to know. We're going to cover things that split up your
2:39:12
workflows. For example, an if else branch where if a condition is met, it goes in one direction or if a condition
2:39:18
is not met, it goes into another direction. Uh things like filtering where we have x amount of items in a
2:39:24
workflow hits that filter and it decreases it. And merges where you have
2:39:30
multiple flows and they merge together into one direction. There's a ton of
2:39:35
different nodes we're going to cover in this section. I think like 10 or so. And yeah, without wasting time, let's jump
2:39:41
into it because we also have a few different example workflows we'll build here at the very end of it. All right,
2:39:46
so the first one that we need to cover is our edit set node. And you might say, well, I've already learned a lot about
2:39:53
this node. And that is 100% correct. But there is a few different use cases of
2:39:59
why edit set is really impactful. And I just wanted to cover those first before
2:40:05
we jump into these other notes. So why is edit set helpful? Well, the first thing that you can do with edit set is
2:40:12
rename a field. So let's go over here and I'll show you this example. Let's say for example you
2:40:18
had something as name and I'll just put name as Ryan over here. However, you
2:40:24
decide at some point and maybe this is like an item a little bit earlier in we have this name but you say hey in the
2:40:31
final output this name over here should actually just be first name. And guess
2:40:36
what? We have officially cleaned this up. And you can see we have
2:40:41
first name like that. I showed you in the last lecture, we could combine
2:40:46
multiple inputs into one specific field. So that is another option that is quite
2:40:53
popular. Another thing is just cleaning up your data. Sometimes you might have,
2:40:59
you know, 10 or 15 different fields. So, say, imagine you have a spreadsheet and you don't care about having all the
2:41:05
fields. Like, let's imagine you have a name. We'll have income. Let's say I make 5,000, which obviously I don't. Um,
2:41:12
we'll put over here that is a number. And we'll add one more thing. Let's say we add in
2:41:19
nan YouTube videos. Nan YouTube vids. And I have 75,
2:41:25
which I believe this is video 75 if it's out in time. But really like I only care
2:41:31
about name and income. I don't I don't care if someone made any on YouTube videos. Well, your edit set will allow
2:41:36
you to do that because it only passes for the things that you clarify in over here. So you can see the option you have
2:41:42
include other input fields if you create a field and this will put everything in over here, right? Including this one
2:41:49
that's been relabeled. You can go over here and filter and choose selected fields all accept. So there's a lot of
2:41:55
different options that you could specifically choose from over there. You could strip binary data as well, include
2:42:02
type conversion or support dot notation. So reality what you want to use edit set
2:42:08
first. You can re label data as I showed you over here. You can create new fields
2:42:13
as I showed you as well. So like again I'll just do it one more time. We'll say income YouTube
2:42:21
and let's just say for some reason we wanted to add our name and income. So
2:42:26
you literally just can go over here. We'll do name and not name. Sorry. I
2:42:32
meant to go over here and use a number and choose income and YouTube videos. So
2:42:37
like for whatever reason you want to do that. Remember these need to be inside here as well. Um put that over here like
2:42:45
that. There's other ways you could add too, but you can do some sort of modification to a field. You could put
2:42:51
that over there. You can add in fields. You can exclude fields. Really helpful after a spreadsheet. I use this all the
2:42:58
time. And you'll see a lot of people also use edit set for just testing purposes to create uh specific data. So
2:43:05
that is our edit set. Next one we should talk about is our if node and if node is
2:43:12
very very popular if you come from programming. If you are a programmer, you know about if else and that's
2:43:19
essentially what we have in any end. So we have this if and you'll see we have a
2:43:24
lot of different options. So we can go over here and have options for a string. So we have string variations. So we have
2:43:31
number variations like if a number exists or not is equal to etc. We'll cover a lot more of these here in a
2:43:38
second. We have date and time. We also have our booleans. Right? If you
2:43:43
remember our true and false, well that's our booleans. We have array and we have
2:43:49
object. Now object is quite simplified because it is a complex data type but
2:43:54
array has a lot more interesting information such as the length of the array which is the number of items
2:43:59
inside that specific array. So you can set specify that uh your boolean. So
2:44:04
let's just cover some of these examples. We'll create an edit fields over here,
2:44:10
an edit set, and we'll populate that into if. And let's take a look at this.
2:44:15
This is the first time we've actually started uh adding in some cool logic into our workflows where our workflow
2:44:22
will go in one direction or our workflow will go in other direction based off of the incoming item. So, let's take a look
2:44:29
at it. First thing we should take a look at is let's do our string. And we'll set
2:44:35
a string over here. We'll say this is a band and let's put
2:44:40
in goose. Listen them a little bit earlier today. And we have our band
2:44:46
being goose. So let's take a look at some of our stuff. First thing we're going to put our value one over here.
2:44:52
And we'll put value two. And we'll say this is equal to goose. So if that is true, it goes into this branch. And then
2:44:59
we could do some logic a little bit later on. And if it's false, it goes into this branch. So that is very
2:45:07
simple, right? Like goose is equal to goose. Well, and what if it's not equal to? Well, goes into the false branch.
2:45:12
And you can see in the output now we have two different sides. We have a true branch and we have a false branch. And
2:45:19
one of the things that you'll find kind of interesting is when we start having control logic like an if statement, we
2:45:26
can't pin our data. So you can see that pin icon is gone whereas it's available
2:45:32
over here. So take a look at it once again. You do not have that particular
2:45:38
option. All right. So going back into this over here, exists, does not exist, is empty,
2:45:44
is not empty. So obviously we have values in this JSON.band. So these are
2:45:50
going to exist and it's not empty. So you can see like for example is not empty. This helps depending on like when
2:45:56
you have data coming through a workflow. In some weird cases, you're not going to have uh specific data and you would want
2:46:02
to filter based around that. Very common if you're working with databases and things like that, but um you're quite
2:46:08
early on in your NAN uh learnings. So I wouldn't focus primarily to about it, but something worth bringing up. Uh we
2:46:15
already covered is equal to not equal to contains. So contains is interesting. So
2:46:20
obviously goose is going to contain goose. But if we do contain all we have
2:46:26
to do is look for something in it. So let's imagine we're looking for the string OS within goose. Well, it's true
2:46:32
because OS is OS right over here. And that means goose contains OS. Uh if we
2:46:39
keep going through does not contain well this will turn false because OS is available in there. Starts with is the
2:46:45
beginning of a string. So this will turn false because uh goose does not start with OS. However, if you just start un
2:46:52
with a G, it's going to be true because that is the first letter. But you can obviously add in others as well. Let's
2:46:58
say goo like this. Obviously, it will still be true. The opposite does not start with ends with also kind of the
2:47:05
opposite, right? And this is at the very end of our particular string. This is going to turn false. But if we go over
2:47:12
here and say E, we know it's going to be true because it ends in O. And again, it
2:47:19
could be any of these variations over there. does not end with you have that
2:47:24
reg X I wouldn't really worry about reg X on the side of it reg X is pretty
2:47:30
powerful and if you want to use reg X at this point I would probably just recommend prompting ALM but this is just
2:47:37
from uh complicated ways of matching and regex is really popular within
2:47:43
programming in fact when I did a Python video on regex it was like an hour and a half long I didn't even memorize all
2:47:49
these regex codes I just literally looked them up So a lot of the things that you're particularly probably going
2:47:55
to search for are going to be in most of these where it's like is empty all the way down to does not end with these are
2:48:01
some rare obscure cases we're going to look at specific regex. So that is the
2:48:06
string side of it. What I want to do now is cover integers. So I'm just going to go or sorry numbers and we'll put
2:48:13
something called like Spotify plays and let's say Spotify plays is a
2:48:19
million. So, we're at a thousand now. We're at a million over there. Pretty
2:48:24
sure. Let me just double check. Yeah, we're good. Cool. So, we have Spotify plays and let's jump into our next one.
2:48:32
So, this is number again. We talked about exist versus not empty. We can put
2:48:37
our number over here. And yeah, so we'll go on that side of things
2:48:44
and just take a look at Spotify plays. So, I'll drag and drop that over here.
2:48:49
And uh looks like I have an issue. And you know what? I do have an issue
2:48:55
because this is still a string. I should have checked that. You can see now it is fixed. And you know this is would be a
2:49:01
common example. If you have a workflow, you get an error like what is going on? I I can't solve it. Well, it's because
2:49:06
of the data type. So now we can see our true branch is as well as 1 million. So
2:49:14
another interesting thing to add on when we're using if else everything gets dragged along with it. You can see over
2:49:21
in our edit set we had both a band as well as Spotify plays and those are in
2:49:27
our output. You can see that in the schema and well both of that is passed into our true branch. Just to skim
2:49:34
through these you have equal to not equal to you have greater than or less than. So with the greater than side of
2:49:40
things, this is actually going to turn false because they are actually equal. And it's specifically looking for a
2:49:46
number that is greater than a million. And because a million is equal to it, that is not the case. Same with is less
2:49:52
than. A million is not a less than million. It's equal. So that'll also turn false. However, if you want to have
2:49:58
it where it's greater than or equal to or less than or equal to, you have those options in here. Again, something that's
2:50:04
pretty popular with programming. And those will both return true over there for either of them. And then we'll just
2:50:10
go over there and choose stats. Great. Now, let's add on another in
2:50:17
here. And we'll say like live dates. We can put something over here. And
2:50:23
we'll want to put this as a string as well. And let's say 01 01 2026.
2:50:34
and we'll actually remove those single quotes and you'll see we have that. And
2:50:39
let's take a look at changing that up. So our live date over here, we'll take a look at date and time. And we'll start
2:50:46
off with is not empty just to show you that it's not empty. It's true. Great. Uh we'll say is equal to and we can put
2:50:55
in our exact date. So we can go over here and choose this and we'll grab
2:51:00
specifically this over here. And this actually shows as false. And
2:51:07
that is because this date over here is formatted differently. You can see 0101
2:51:12
2026. Whereas this one over here, take a look at the date format. We actually have that timestamp over here like that.
2:51:19
And by default, it has that. So this isn't the approach to write in specific dates. And I'll show you that a little
2:51:25
bit later on how we could solve this particular date issue. So that does
2:51:31
throw up or throw some confusion into people. And actually has a specific date node. So we'll cover that here in a
2:51:37
little bit, but you can see we have is after, is before, is after equal to or is before, equal to. Again, we'll cover
2:51:44
dates. I believe I actually have that in this section too. Yeah, that's one of my next nodes we're going to cover. So
2:51:50
don't worry about that side of it. Okay. Uh we're going to cover really quick booleans. This is super easy. So we'll
2:51:57
say I don't know still touring. We'll say like still
2:52:04
touring. And obviously Goose is still touring as of now. We'll go over here and do boolean. And we'll say that is
2:52:11
true. Great. We have that. And then we can
2:52:16
just go over here and do still touring. We'll go into our boolean
2:52:22
is true. And it goes to true branch. It's false.
2:52:27
And honestly, like any ant team probably should have just kept it there because you have is equal to and is not equal
2:52:33
to. But personally, I would just recommend staying that is true is false. Then we have our array side of it. And
2:52:40
really array is just based off of the lengths. So you can just put array. We'll say like songs.
2:52:47
It'll say songs. We could just fill this out over here. Here you can put like your direction
2:52:57
site. Just put those two like that. Cool.
2:53:03
And uh actually, you know, this is probably a string right now. I need to fix that.
2:53:08
Good call out. And I need to put a comma.
2:53:15
Whoops. I do have an error. And that's because the other single quote. Third times the charm, right? Boom. There we
2:53:21
go. Great. So now we can just do some uh if else based off of our array. So you
2:53:28
can see JSON songs array. So what we can do is if it contains a
2:53:34
value, we'll say contains your direction.
2:53:41
And you'll see it goes into the true branch. If I do your directions, it's going to be false. It's looking for that
2:53:47
exact case. Then we can go back over here. We'll change this out and say is length is
2:53:53
equal to and this time it's going to look for a length of two for it to be true. And it is because we have two
2:53:59
songs in here and that's why it's true. So you can array interesting because you can look and filter based off of
2:54:05
multiple things whether it is strings or numbers. Um you can go also over here length not
2:54:13
equal to and it's the same as earlier the length greater than or less than. So this is looking just absolutely is this
2:54:19
greater than something or less than whereas then or equal to if the values are equal or not. So when it's like less
2:54:25
than or equal to two that'll be correct. However, if you go over here and say less than two or greater than two both
2:54:31
those are going to go into that particular false branch. You'll see that there's other things for objects. It's
2:54:36
literally just asking if it exists or not. Uh you can also convert types when it's required. You have this option over
2:54:43
there. And you can ignore case. So, let me show you an example of ignore case. Let's go first and go into our array and
2:54:51
we're going to do a contains and we're going to go your direction like this. And you'll see even though we have your
2:54:56
direction here as well as right over here, it's going to show false. You'll see both populate as false. Why? This is
2:55:04
your direction. So, if you think someone has some bad data in some sort of capacity,
2:55:10
there you go. Your direction now is matching. It ignores the capitalization
2:55:16
associated with it. This was like a super fast walkthrough of the if node.
2:55:22
And like all the nodes I'm going to cover here, I have detailed videos, sometimes 20, 30, 40 minutes on each of
2:55:28
these to be respectful for your guys time watching this course. I'm not going to go over every single example. But if
2:55:36
you really want that detail of, hey, I want to know everything about the if node. I want to know everything about a
2:55:41
filter note or a date and time. just watch the individual videos on the channel. I go into greater detail, but
2:55:47
there's so much to cover in one video. Um, I'm not going to do 40 minutes of if within this course. So, the next one I
2:55:54
wanted to do really fast is switch. So, switch is a little bit more of a leveled
2:56:00
up if because essentially what you can do is you can create multiple branches
2:56:06
whereas if is stuck with true or false. So if I go into switch, you'll notice I
2:56:12
keep adding out routing rules and we have route one, we have route two, we
2:56:17
have route three and you know 012 just doesn't doesn't hit it. So we can go
2:56:22
over here and we can rename these outputs and let's go back to some of the music I
2:56:28
listen to. We could say one of these outputs is rock or metal
2:56:34
or bluegrass. miscellaneous.
2:56:45
Okay. And now you can see these are relabeled. We have rock, metal, bluegrass. We can add in an edit set.
2:56:52
And let me show you how this works. So we'll go over here. We'll just say a genre.
2:57:00
Go over here. We'll say artists first. Throw in good old Billy Strings.
2:57:06
And then we'll go in and say genre but bluegrass
2:57:13
bats. So pretty basic two two strings over here artist and genre. We go into
2:57:19
our switch and then we're going to look for this. We're going to say genre is equal to rock. So we'll say rock over
2:57:27
here. Do the same thing over here. Is the genre equal to metal?
2:57:36
And actually, we don't need this third one over here. Because what I like doing is if these conditions aren't met, we
2:57:43
can actually go into an add option and create some sort of fallback output. So
2:57:49
none, you can say extra output, output rock, output metal. I always call it an extra output over here. So items will be
2:57:55
sent to the extra separate output. You can also rename that fallback output.
2:58:00
And I can just rename it blue grass or miscellaneous. So you can see since we have over here bluegrass and that
2:58:08
doesn't fit rock or metal, it goes into this additional one over here. So that's
2:58:13
just kind of your fallback. Now if I just wanted to say, hey, you know, bluegrass really should be its own genre
2:58:19
over here. And we'll just say the other one's miscellaneous. So bluegrass like
2:58:26
this. And uh rename that. And hey, again, we
2:58:31
just want to keep this as miscellaneous. So now you'll see it populates under bluegrass. And now we have a fourth one.
2:58:38
So pretty important that you set a fallback of some capacity. Otherwise, you're going to lose some sort of data.
2:58:44
So highly recommend that you build out that as we talked about in the previous node, convert types when required.
2:58:52
Probably highly recommend you do that as well if you have some capitalization issues. As I showed in the the previous
2:58:57
node, you have the option for ignore case as well as convert type. So if your capitalization is going to be messed up,
2:59:04
ignore case. And one interesting thing is this send data to all matching outputs. So let's say you have some sort
2:59:11
of switch statement where hey an item could fit in multiple buckets
2:59:16
and you know in music side of it there's artists that you know play a mixture of
2:59:22
rock and bluegrass or metal and bluegrass or whatever else the case may be. So they might want to populate in each
2:59:28
of these over here. So that's where this option would be send data all matching outputs. So if they match and matches
2:59:35
multiple it goes over there. And yeah, that's kind of the basics of our switch. Ideally, you can really build this out
2:59:42
and add a lot of different uh conditions around that. Okay, so our next thing is
2:59:49
going to be very similar to our switch and if and this is going to be our filter. And our filter essentially what
2:59:56
it does is it removes items based off of a filter. So, and we've already talked
3:00:02
about some of the different rules within our if, you can see we have things for our string. So, if a string is equal to
3:00:09
something, you see all this over here. Number, date and time, boolean, array,
3:00:15
object. You can see we can convert types as well. We also have the ignore case.
3:00:20
And we can start off with just a very basic filter. And why this helps is
3:00:26
let's imagine you have 100 items in your workflow and you want to filter some of these out uh just based off a condition
3:00:32
and it'll go down to 25 items. So I'm not going to give you that direct example, but what we'll do is we'll
3:00:39
create an edit fields of an array and we'll split this out. So we'll go over
3:00:45
here and we'll start off with just some numbers in an array. So, we'll just say
3:00:51
random numbers, which are not technically random, but for purposes of this video, they are random numbers.
3:00:59
We're going to go into an array and we're going to put a bunch of different values. So, say 55, 21, 66, 77, 22, 11.
3:01:10
Done. I'm not caring too much about these numbers, but what we'll do is turn
3:01:16
each of those from an array into a specific item. I do that with split out.
3:01:21
So, it says start a list inside items into separate items. Again, this is very popular with arrays. Should probably
3:01:28
execute the previous node. Pass that in over here. And we'll cover this also in
3:01:33
this section, but you'll see now we have six particular items. Schema view doesn't really show that that well.
3:01:39
table view does as well as JSON. So, as I mentioned earlier in the course,
3:01:44
schema just pretty much shows you what data types you have. A table is really good for CSV data and JSON shows you a
3:01:51
lot as well. So, okay, great. We have six different numbers now we can pass into this filter. Let's take a look at a
3:01:57
number value. So, we'll say random numbers. If random number over here is less than, we'll say 25, we're going to
3:02:05
filter that out. And then we're going to look at random numbers. If this is less than 25, we're going to keep it.
3:02:10
Otherwise, we're going to filter it out. So, it kept 21, it kept 22, it kept 11, and it filtered out 55, 66, and 77. And
3:02:19
you can see that we only have three items afterwards when we're only going to have the items
3:02:24
that are kept. So, if we flip it and say we're going to only keep numbers that are greater than 25, you can see 55, 66,
3:02:32
and 77. So let's say we want to change this up and say greater than 55. We only
3:02:37
keep 66 and 77 where we disregarded these four other items. Pretty powerful
3:02:43
on that. And then we can also add in additional condition as well. So we can say it's greater than 55 and less than
3:02:51
70. So we can use either an and or. So we're going to use and in this example.
3:02:57
So, we're going to copy the same exact thing and we're going to say number is
3:03:02
less than and we're going to say less than 75.
3:03:08
And you'll see we only have one. However, if we do or that means one of
3:03:13
these conditions has to be true. So, technically the number has to be greater than 55 which will populate the 66 or it
3:03:22
has to be less than 75. So, that's less than 75. it'll populate less than 75.
3:03:28
This is false for both. So it'll still be disregarded. This hits the criteria as well. And this hits it. So you can
3:03:34
see it kept all of these over here because all these numbers are either greater than 55 or less than 75. Uh we
3:03:43
could change this up as well. I will say is greater than um we'll actually make
3:03:50
this to 70. You can see it's all the same as well. Let me change this up. So, we're going
3:03:56
to say it's greater than 55 or is less than 20.
3:04:03
So, this should get us a different number. So, 66, 77, and 11 because
3:04:08
that's greater than 55, greater than 55. This is less than 20. You go to 55,
3:04:14
right? It's not greater than 55 and it's not less than 20. Uh, this is not less than 20 over here, but it's greater than
3:04:21
that. And 22 like that, too. So kept three of those disregarded and can or
3:04:27
only one of these has to be true and every condition has to be true and you can see you can add more conditions as
3:04:32
well depending on how complicated you want this filter to be and it's really great because you can limit the amount
3:04:38
of results. Another thing that's kind of used within testing and we'll just briefly cover it is limit. So you can
3:04:44
see it says restrict the number of items over here and you can see it says max
3:04:50
items that you want to keep. So I am just going to remove this filter and we'll keep it in this workflow because
3:04:56
you guys can download this workflow and I really don't want to ruin it for you guys. But we'll throw that over here.
3:05:02
And actually you know what we are just going to copy that way you guys can follow along.
3:05:09
And we'll just limit this. So this we can say limit items into three. And this
3:05:16
escapes the first items over here. So you can see we have 55 216. It kept first three or we can keep the last
3:05:23
items. So it'll keep the last three over here. We can change this number as well. Uh we can put this to five. Keeps five
3:05:30
items. We can put this to two. If it's larger, it keeps everything. Let's say we keep 10. Can keep them all. So
3:05:36
another way just to limit the amount of results that are passed through. I use limit a lot when it comes to testing. So
3:05:43
if I don't want to send all my items throughout a workflow and I'm personally using testing in some sort of capacity,
3:05:48
that's when I use uh limit. Okay. Next, I think what we should cover in a little
3:05:54
bit greater detail is date and time. So going back into our date and time is I I
3:06:01
did mention I was going to talk about this. You can also get a date pretty
3:06:06
easily or format a date. So all you have to do on the side of things is use this node and you can see it says format a
3:06:14
date. It does mention you could also do this over here with the schema. So your
3:06:19
date.format. Uh so let me show you this example from earlier.
3:06:25
We had this if I think this is it. Just double check. Yeah. So we'll grab that.
3:06:32
We'll pass it over here. And let's say we want to pass in our dates. So I'm just going to execute the previous node
3:06:40
and I will grab this live date. So now we can actually format this date and you
3:06:45
can see we have 11 1 2026 but we have different formats and you can see depending where you're at people format
3:06:52
dates differently. So this is month month day year year. You can change it where years are first. You can add in
3:06:58
time stamps as well. So you can see that it's a specific time stamp. Uh you can
3:07:03
go MS. It really obviously depends on what you particularly want to do. You
3:07:09
have also custom formatting as well. And uh you can see we have more info over
3:07:14
here. And this talks about all the different format options. And obviously I'm not going to cover that in today's
3:07:19
video because that just crazy. But I have a full video talking about formatting and dates and things like
3:07:25
that. You can also change the name of the date as well. You can include the
3:07:30
input fields, which I would just recommend that you include this because it has everything else over here. You
3:07:36
could literally just filter out in the future this specific live date. Um, what
3:07:42
else? You could use the workflow time zone. I think that's pretty important. And you have opt other options too. So,
3:07:49
this was just formatting. You could also extract part of a date, which I mean you could do that with JSON as well. You
3:07:55
could add to a date. So you can have a date and say what's 180 days from now. So you can just say what's 180 days,
3:08:03
right? Uh you can also get the current date which I would just use now anyways
3:08:08
in JSON. Get the time between two particular dates. So if you want to find
3:08:14
start date and end date, how many days are they between? You can grab that. You can round dates. And also the opposite
3:08:20
of adding to a date, you could subtract from a date. also mentions this over
3:08:26
here as the expression that you could utilize but you could also just throw this in the particular node. So if you
3:08:32
are working with date and time which I think everyone does in some capacity I I
3:08:37
don't really see this node talked about that often and obviously a lot of this could be just used with JSON you could
3:08:44
just format your dates based around it but I kind of like having that particular node. All right. Uh, so we
3:08:51
covered edit, we covered if, covered filter, date and time, we covered switch. So let's talk about another way
3:08:58
that you guys could clean up your data. And what we have is a node for removing
3:09:04
duplicates. So we'll see over here it says remove items repeated within current input. Remove items process in
3:09:10
previous executions or clear dduplication history. For ease of use,
3:09:16
what we're going to do is remove items repeated within a current input. We'll talk about the other one here in a second. So I want to go back over here
3:09:23
and use this example. We're actually going to modify this a little bit. So in
3:09:28
over here, what we're going to take a look at is pretend we have another
3:09:33
duplicate. So let's say we have 11 and then we have 21. So a few duplication
3:09:40
22. So few numbers that are duplicated. You can see we have nine total numbers.
3:09:46
We split these out. So each of these numbers are an item. And then we're going to go into remove duplicates. And
3:09:53
what we're going to do is compare selected fields. And I would just recommend that you choose a field. So
3:09:59
I'm going to use random numbers over here. And this is only going to remove items repeated within the current input.
3:10:06
And you can see this now goes down into six. We're at nine items now six. And the reason is the last three were
3:10:12
duplicated. You can take a look at this table. 22, 21, and 11. So it removes that in here directly. Now this is where
3:10:19
you need to be a little bit careful or uh this is kind of in your benefit as well. So if we actually choose remove
3:10:25
items process in previous executions, imagine you have some sort of like a a unique identifier and you only want that
3:10:32
identifier to go once through a workflow. Well, uh that is where this
3:10:37
would take place. So remove items process and previous executions. If you don't want this item ever to be through
3:10:43
this workflow again, which is rare that you choose that and then if you choose
3:10:48
that, you'd want to have something uh for the clear the duty duplication history. So just one use case for
3:10:55
example is let's say you want to I don't know reach out to people in your CRM
3:11:01
once a month and you reach out to everyone and they have a unique
3:11:06
identifier and well you want to reset that maybe one time a month you reset it automatically with this clear
3:11:11
dduplication history. I don't know that's just something I thought of on top of my head. I don't use it that often but that is an option over there.
3:11:18
And you can see disable dot notation or remove other fields if you want to use that. I just choose selected fields and
3:11:25
go through there. Um, okay. So, we remove duplicates. Let's talk a little bit more about split out as well. I
3:11:33
think it's time to talk about this. So, essentially what we're doing with split out is, and you hopefully you kind of
3:11:39
figured this out by now. within an array. You have multiple items in over here like 55, 21, 66, 77, like discounts
3:11:48
as one item currently, the array, but you could split this out and go from one item to many. And actually, if you take
3:11:54
a look at the icon, that's literally what it's showing you. You have one item coming in and it builds out multiple.
3:11:59
So, you just choose the field that you want to split out. You can also include other fields or selected other fields.
3:12:06
So let's say for example I had I don't know what's going to be a good thing.
3:12:11
We'll just say um I don't know random number ID. I don't
3:12:19
know let's say like when you generate random numbers you have like an integer associated with it. So let's say the the
3:12:26
repeat results in programming. I'll just say like 11 on the side of it. So we have this random number ID. It's kind of
3:12:32
bizarre, but I think we can throw that in over here and we'll include all their
3:12:38
fields. So now you can see 11 is associated with each of these where earlier we had 11 once and then this
3:12:45
array. So hopefully that kind of makes sense as an example. Um 11's kind of attributed to each of these and we can
3:12:51
just pass them like that. You could also choose selected other fields and choose one thing if you really want to. Um, so
3:12:58
you can see if I want to grab that or that over here. This depends obviously if you have a lot of fields. So you can
3:13:04
either choose all of them or select it as well. This will get the same exact results. Disable dot notations here.
3:13:10
Again, destination field name. You can re label this and you say instead of random numbers, let's say randomly
3:13:17
generated number. And uh yeah, that's essentially it. You
3:13:24
have binary files, you can pass that through, too. But you can re label that and it's honestly a pretty easy node
3:13:31
just to kind of walk through on that side of things. So I'm back another day
3:13:37
recording. So if you see this shirt change that is why um we're going to continue to move forward with a few
3:13:44
other nodes. I also made the choice to put some of the essential nodes in later
3:13:50
parts of the course such as like when we start working with binary files because I think they'll make sense over there.
3:13:57
Um but I still have three more to cover in this section and then also to workflows. So the next two nodes are
3:14:04
going to be very similar. Uh they're going to be called agate as well as summarize and it's the opposite of split
3:14:10
out. So if we go over here and we go to aggregate, you'll see it's combined a field from many items from a list into a
3:14:17
single item. So I just want to populate this probably after split out just to show you how this works. So I'm just
3:14:24
going to copy this over here and throw it in. And I'm just going to like that.
3:14:30
And check this out. So in our edit fields, if you remember, we had this array on this random number ID. We
3:14:37
actually split out the random numbers over here. And actually may execute this to refresh it. So you can see all these
3:14:43
were split out over there. I'm not going to include this random number ID anymore
3:14:49
as well. So I'm just going to remove this over here. I'm going to execute this step and
3:14:56
hold on a second. Let's go over here. Okay. So we have our random numbers like
3:15:02
that. And uh no other fields. That's why I have the error. And you can see in our
3:15:09
table we have nine items over here. But when we go into aggregate we're going to do the opposite. So we're going to take
3:15:17
those nine items and then populate a new field. So you can see we are back into
3:15:22
one particular item essentially how we started. Right? If we go to our schema view, go to our schema view, these are
3:15:28
nearly identical minus this random number ID which honestly we didn't really need for this example over here.
3:15:35
Now there is a few other options that are worth mentioning. So first you can rename this field. A lot of the time I
3:15:41
do find this helpful just keeping things clean. So you should be able to throw that in over here. Uh you can also merge
3:15:48
lists include binary files as well. Keep missing and null values. So if your data
3:15:54
is just gone and you want to still keep these uh you would put in this missing
3:16:00
and no values field. So obviously I have all these numbers defined over here, but if that's the case that there's stuff
3:16:06
that's missing, you would want to choose that. I find it helpful. So that is pretty easy. It's simple. You could also
3:16:15
have all item data into a single list over there. But that's aggregate. And I
3:16:21
don't use a aggregate actually as much as this other node. And uh why I use
3:16:26
this other node, I just find there's a little bit more that you could do with it. And this is summarize over here. And
3:16:33
with summarize essentially what we could do is you have different types of
3:16:38
aggregations. So like this aggregate on steroids is essentially summarize.
3:16:46
And you can see we have append average concatenate count count unique max min
3:16:51
sum. So, we're going just going to literally copy what we have over here and we're going to walk through a few of these different examples and also kind
3:16:58
of explain why this node should probably used a lot more than aggregate or an AN
3:17:04
team could should probably combine these together. Um, I honestly think that's probably the best approach, but it's
3:17:09
probably too late because of just how workflows are out there. All right, so we're just going to execute this step.
3:17:14
Again, I'm just going to remove this random number ID just to keep things clean. And uh we'll split this out. And
3:17:22
now we go to the summarize. And let's go through some of these aggregations. And you could think of this as like
3:17:28
different tasks that a data analyst or a data scientist would perform on a data set. So you might say like, oh, how many
3:17:35
items are in here? And well, there's nine. And you can see it automatically creates count random numbers. So we see
3:17:42
account and then it populates in front of random numbers. So I think it's pretty helpful that we already rename
3:17:47
it. We can also find the average. So you can see there's 34 over here. You can
3:17:53
count unique. So how many of these numbers are truly unique or not? And you can see six. We have a few different
3:17:59
duplicates. What's the maximum over here? What is the minimum?
3:18:05
What is the sum? Again, just something really easy that you could populate in
3:18:11
two seconds to find some statistics. Obviously, there's other data points I wish that were in here like median. Um,
3:18:17
maybe that's helpful thinking, but really it's like, okay, why
3:18:23
why does this matter? Like, you keep saying summarize is better than aggregate. Well, what happens sometimes
3:18:30
I want to send all of my items to our AI agent. One of the ways that we could do
3:18:36
this actually is go into concatenate. And what's really nice is we have different options on how to concatenate
3:18:42
all these numbers. All right. So you can see there's different options to how we would want to concatenate. So by just
3:18:48
putting a comma we put all this together like this. You can also put comma and a space. And you can see now we have a
3:18:54
little bit more formatting associated with that. Then you can also put all these on new lines. You'll see slashn
3:19:00
that stands for a specific new line. Then we have none. So this is just going
3:19:06
to put everything all together. I don't really use this that often with none. We have space and you can see all these are
3:19:12
space like that. And then we have other which you can define whatever separator you want. And you can see like for
3:19:19
example I just put three dashes and then there's the dashes like that. So sometimes I have a bunch of different
3:19:24
items and I want to populate these within let's say for an example an email newsletter. uh summarize will allow me
3:19:30
to do that like really really easily and then apply the formatting where I want to where aggregate really doesn't give
3:19:36
me that option to do that and uh again just look at concatenate where we're combining all these together concatenate
3:19:43
them and we can just specify however format we want we also do have the option append over here and you can see
3:19:50
all these are together like that um and you can take a look at the table view
3:19:55
this is essentially what we've already had go back over here just to show you right 0 through eight this is an array
3:20:02
we have all this over here again just going we have specific array
3:20:09
cool so you can also include empty values if you want there's other options so disable nitation output format um so
3:20:16
you can each split into separate item or all splits into a single item and you
3:20:21
have ignore items with valid fields to group by um so you can also group by specific things as necessary But there's
3:20:28
a lot more nuances associated with this. I just wanted to share this with you guys uh because it's really really
3:20:35
impactful. All right, the last node and and actually with this node itself,
3:20:40
we're going to have to grab our manual trigger just because it does bug out if you don't have this. And this is going
3:20:47
to be the merge node. And merges are used all the time by people in data
3:20:54
because what ends up happening is at least in a database you have data coming from multiple tables and you want to
3:21:01
combine this together in some sort of report and obviously you're like well that doesn't matter for any end. Well
3:21:07
kind of does because in any end often you're going to have multiple branches
3:21:12
in a workflow and you're going to have to merge them together. So why this
3:21:17
happens? So first off in nan itself sometimes you're going to have a decision logic like an if else and your
3:21:24
workflow will split into multiple parts sometimes it can be really difficult to access data a little bit earlier on in
3:21:31
the workflow. So what I tend to do is from I have a data point earlier in a workflow I'll create another line and
3:21:38
then merge it post everything going on. I know that doesn't really make sense right now because we've gone through a
3:21:44
lot of very basic examples, but I promise you like if you want to access data that's a little bit earlier in your
3:21:50
workflow and sometimes you can't access it with JSON, merge is going to be your best friend. In addition, sometimes
3:21:56
you're going to have to merge from different sources. Like merge is a very important skill to have if you want to
3:22:01
build out um some great workflows. So obviously there's a lot going on with
3:22:07
merge and I do want to also show you a small bug within merge 2 that I hope
3:22:12
that any end team does eventually solve. I haven't flagged this to them but I will bring that up. So first let me show
3:22:20
you how this is done properly. We're going to just create uh two different data points over here. We're going to
3:22:26
say edit fields. We're going to do this twice and we're going to start off with the the most basics of merges and we're
3:22:34
going to do something called append. And if you come from the data world, this is union. Essentially, what we're doing is stacking data on top of each other. So,
3:22:41
let's go over here and we're going to create two long runs. So, one of my favorite sports is running. And uh when
3:22:48
you're doing training, you're going to have to do long distance runs. Today, for recording this video, I did 30
3:22:53
miles. Last weekend, my long run was 19 miles. It's completely different long run. That one was 19 miles on the road.
3:23:01
Today was on the trail. So we have both of our long runs over here. And you know what? Again, imagine like we have a lot
3:23:08
more items of trail runs over here, a lot more items of road run. We actually want to merge these together. And real
3:23:16
world, you can imagine maybe I have a spreadsheet with just trail runs, a spreadsheet with just road running. And
3:23:23
now I want to combine this together over there. Again, you might say like, well, you could just have had that in general.
3:23:28
Sure, but trying to just give you an idea. All right, so you can see and
3:23:33
these pretty basic. We have long run 30, etc. Why we need this? Let me just
3:23:38
populate this over here and execute this. You'll see that we have um and
3:23:44
that's actually another good point. Make sure when you're using append, these are the exact same because you'll see I have
3:23:51
long runs and then long run. And if these aren't the same exact value,
3:23:57
you'll have undefined as the other one. So super important that you make sure
3:24:03
are the same. Watch what happens now. Great. So we have a long run. We have 30
3:24:09
and then 19. So these are stacked together. We have two items over here. So we have the item over here. We have
3:24:14
the item over here. And we just stacked them. So they're individual items. But now we have two items with our specific
3:24:21
append. And this is also kind of where a bug in Nan is. So let me show you this
3:24:27
bug because I've encountered it a few different times. And I was really hoping this was something that would be solved in V2. So imagine we're doing some sort
3:24:34
of testing. I'm not using a trigger over here. And I know some people are going to probably say like should always have
3:24:39
a trigger even with testing purposes or making up videos. That's fine. So uh we
3:24:46
go back into this merge over here. Try to execute this step. Now this doesn't the merge doesn't work. it only grabs
3:24:52
the bottom section. You can see that doesn't work. So, if if we put our
3:25:00
manual over here, now we get the two items. So, if you're doing some sort of testing and you're like, man, why is my
3:25:07
merge not working? Um, make sure that you have a trigger over here. I learned
3:25:13
this the hard way and it's it's embarrassing to say this. uh my full-time job, we had a hackathon with
3:25:18
some of our customers and essentially and I I don't do AI consulting
3:25:24
full-time. I work at a fintech as a data scientist, but ideally one of our customers was building out an AN
3:25:31
workflow and we're trying to get a merge to work and I didn't have a trigger here
3:25:36
and I was getting these results on the end. I'm like obviously the one item not too. I'm like what is going on? Why can
3:25:42
I not get this to work? And I literally tried to spend like 15 minutes trying to solve the issue. I'm like, I know how
3:25:48
bridge works, just couldn't get it to work. And then I threw on a manual trigger for testing and it worked. So, a
3:25:55
very weird bug that's in any N. I need I'll bring it up to the team and see if they do anything about it. But if you do
3:26:02
have that issue, just make sure in testing you have that. There's other options as well for the merge node, not
3:26:09
just appending, which is like stacking our data together. Uh, so you could actually write a SQL query and this is
3:26:16
for the people that may have a like data analytics background and I'm not going to cover all SQL in today's video. In
3:26:22
fact, um, I have probably like 10 or 15 different SQL videos here on the channel. If you honestly watch my 1 hour
3:26:28
SQL course, plenty enough information to jump into this over here, but this is
3:26:33
just kind of a little bit for more advanced joins of your data. So, we'll not cover that over here. You can choose
3:26:39
a branch over here as well. Um, so a choosing branch will only grab data from
3:26:44
one side. So you can see I chose this one. Use data of input one. It's long run 30. We choose this one over here.
3:26:51
It's long run of 19. And then you have combine. So what combine allows you to
3:26:56
do is merge data together. Uh there's a few different ways that you could combine it. You could combine by
3:27:02
matching fields. So combine items with the same field values. You could combine by position. to combine items based off
3:27:08
of their order or all possible combinations. Typically, I'll either use matching fields or specifically
3:27:15
positions. And um again, just depending on what type of join you particular want, why I
3:27:21
use position, just how I have a workflow populating and I just want to have
3:27:26
everything together. Uh, so just to show you over here, this isn't really going to do much because our data over here
3:27:32
doesn't really make that much sense um to combine by position and I didn't really prep for the merge. But if you
3:27:39
watch our merge video on the channel, it's like well over an hour and actually maybe I'll give you an example right now
3:27:44
of combine by position. It might be a little bit out of scope, but I'll just pause this fill this out really quick
3:27:50
for you and we'll be right back. All right. So, I made the two other examples really quick just so that way you guys
3:27:56
can kind of visualize what is going on. Otherwise, if I didn't, I feel like this course just wouldn't go in as much
3:28:02
detail. So, the first one we're going to be taking a look at over here is combine
3:28:07
by matching fields. You also notice that we have code nodes over here. And listen, we're going to have a code node
3:28:13
section within this course. So, don't fret. All I'm using the code node over here just to show you is we're building
3:28:20
out multiple items. So you can see that there's four items associated with it. I could still technically go over here and
3:28:28
use an edit fields and split out to build out multiple items. I personally find the code node is a lot quicker to
3:28:35
build out multiple items for testing. And I'll often do this all the time. Again, we'll cover it in more detail,
3:28:40
but what I have going on over here is I have different products as well as their
3:28:46
category over here. So, four products, laptop, desk, monitor, and chair category, electronics, furniture,
3:28:51
electronics, and furniture. And then over here in our second one, what we have is a discount that the store is
3:28:58
applying for specific categories. So, you can see 10%, 15, 5% electronics, furniture, and clothing. We can actually
3:29:05
join both of these data points off of category, right? There's category in
3:29:11
here. There is category in over here. And there's a lot of different ways that we could join. We'll quickly go through
3:29:17
these. So, how we go over here, we go do combine by position. How we go over
3:29:22
here, we do combine, merge matching items together, and then combine by
3:29:27
matching fields. And these are the same in name. However, if
3:29:33
they have different names, which is very common in the real world, you just click on this fields to match have different
3:29:39
names. Obviously, I did not do that to make this more simple for you. Next, fields to match. They both have a
3:29:46
category. So, we're going to choose category. And then you have different types of output. And I'm just saying
3:29:51
over here to keep matches and output data from both inputs merged together.
3:29:56
You can only choose input one and input two if you want, but most likely if you're going to be combining matching fields, you'll want to have both inputs
3:30:02
merged together. And when I use a step, you can see our product category, and then you can see the discount all in one
3:30:09
section. This is essentially what a data analyst does when they're combining tables. um very rarely you only need you
3:30:15
combine two tables but uh in general this is just a very basic MVP. Now
3:30:22
there's a lot of different ways that you could join data together. So over here
3:30:27
it says output type keep matches and you'll notice it says an inner join. This is probably the most popular
3:30:32
options over here. So only if there's a match it will join. One of the other common ones that you'll often see in the
3:30:40
real world is a left join. And N is kind of interesting because um you have a
3:30:45
left joint or a right joint over here. No one really uses right joints in the real world. Typically you'll use the
3:30:51
main table as um your build out for your left join. However, based off of
3:30:56
orchestration, sometimes you'll want to have the source of truth either input one or input two. That's kind of where you have your left join or right join.
3:31:03
So if we do left join over here, you can see it doesn't really change much. Then
3:31:10
you can see it's called enrich input one. And that's just because all four of these items have a category that's in
3:31:16
here. However, if I change one of these and uh you can see it's electronic clothing furniture. Let's say I just
3:31:22
call laptop consulting. Again, this makes no sense to do this. But we're
3:31:27
going to do this on purpose just to show you what's going to happen. I rerun
3:31:33
this. You'll see this is undefined. Whereas earlier if we did in join that laptop is
3:31:40
going to be dropped. And you can see if I execute step that is no longer there. So inner join will only keep the
3:31:48
matches. If you do this left join over here even if there's a null value in that first input
3:31:55
it's okay. And the opposite for input two. So this time we start from the
3:32:01
discount and you can see there was no clothing. So that's why that is undefined. So you have that. Uh the
3:32:06
other things over here is non-matches. So just show things that don't match in general. This is kind of good for data
3:32:12
cleanup in some capacity. So you can see our laptop which is consulting doesn't have a discount. And then you can see
3:32:17
clothing which doesn't have an item that is missing over there. And then lastly, you have a full outer join which will
3:32:23
show everything all together. Again, I understand it's not going to click, but maybe do some practice with merges. It's
3:32:30
it's really really important. Okay. The other option over here is to combine by
3:32:35
position. And you can see that we have two inputs. This is a little bit different. So what we have over here are
3:32:41
different metal bands. Mishuga Tulle and then Orbit Culture. And then over here what we have is different iconic venues.
3:32:48
So Red Rock Amphitheater as well as Madison Square Garden. I've never been to either of those, but they seem like
3:32:53
they're going to be pretty close. And uh what we do is merge over here. We do combine my position
3:32:59
and nothing is populating because I don't have this execute workflow. It is such a
3:33:07
bummer that you have to always do this testing. All right, so let's rerun this
3:33:12
again. And now it should work. And you can see we only have Mishuga and Tulle. And
3:33:18
you're like, what what happened to the third one? Well, there wasn't a third venue. You can see we only have two
3:33:24
venues over here. And we have three bands. So, unfortunately, Orbit Culture is not playing an iconic menu. They will
3:33:30
in the future. They're going to grow quite a bit as a band, but because it's missing, uh, we have item one over here,
3:33:37
which is Mishuga. They are playing Red Rock AIT, and that'd be an interesting show. Then you have Tulle, and they're
3:33:44
going to play Madison Square Garden, which I think they've played probably multiple times. And unfortunately, Orbit
3:33:50
Culture does not have a venue assigned because they're combining by position. And that is no longer the case. And you
3:33:56
can see the output over here is two particular items. And hopefully that cleared up at least the basics of
3:34:03
merges. And as I've been saying multiple times, if you want to watch another video to talk about merges where it's
3:34:09
just only focused on merges and has like 20 examples, um, go check that out. But
3:34:15
I want to give you guys the examples for this section. So we're going to talk about these. So,
3:34:23
example problems and I actually we're going to try to solve two of them together. So, the first one and I'm just
3:34:29
going to copy this over from my notes. So, what we're going to do is have a
3:34:34
form submission. We're going to look at the form submission with an if node to see if someone has budget and we could
3:34:42
say also have a switch based off of the company size. we can build out some score calculation and then it sends into
3:34:50
a CRM which obviously I haven't shown you how to do the CRM yet so this step will not exist score calculation we can
3:34:58
make something up if you want on that side of things like hey we're just going to sum things up honestly it does not
3:35:04
really matter but I want you to try building this out and I'll just make this note not available yet but this
3:35:12
would be an example of kind of a real workflow that someone might want they have a form, you know, we do some sort
3:35:17
of calculation based off of the form, which, you know, real world, we might be using a code node for this. Obviously,
3:35:23
we haven't currently covered the code node, but really it's just to test out, you know, the form submission, which we've covered, the if node, and then
3:35:29
switch. So, honestly, if you just want to do these three steps and stop there, I'm perfectly okay with this. And I'll
3:35:36
just put over here like don't worry about the rest. how we can always expand on this later in the course, but feel
3:35:42
free to pause the video, try to solve this, and then uh I'll give you the solution. All right, I'm back. Let's
3:35:48
solve this. So, what we're going to do is have a form submission and go in form. We'll go into a trigger. And the
3:35:56
first thing we're going to want to do is build out our two data points. So, uh obviously, actually, we're going to
3:36:01
probably have three data points. So, we're going to say, um consulting services. consulting
3:36:07
services and maybe we have three different form elements. So first we would have like a business name
3:36:15
or you could have like a contact name. It it doesn't matter. We'll just assume we don't need the contact name obviously where we will um what is the business
3:36:24
name and what we'll have next is our first one over here is based off of the
3:36:29
budget. So let's set up our budget. So, we're going to call this budget.
3:36:35
How much can you pay for AI services?
3:36:42
And then lastly, we'll do company size.
3:36:47
And obviously, based off the company size, there might be see different data governance rules. Um, companies with
3:36:53
larger amount of people typically pay a little bit higher for services. Uh, there's obviously more rules that you're
3:36:58
going to have to follow. We're going to say how many are in
3:37:05
make sure that both of these are going to be numbers. So we'll go into numbers like that and uh let's test this out. So
3:37:14
execute. What is the business name? Great. So good to go on that side of things. First thing what we're going to
3:37:20
do is build out an if. So we're going to say if and maybe you have a specific
3:37:26
rule for what this budget should be. I'm also just going to test this out one more time and just fill out some blank
3:37:32
data. Uh we're going to say Ryan's SEO.
3:37:37
How much can you pay for AI services? We'll say 1,200. Also, by the way, when
3:37:43
you're building out forms, you should be explicit because someone might try to put, you know, dollar sign over here. Obviously, it's locked right now. I'm
3:37:50
trying to spam it and it's not working, but just be explicit. And how many people are in your company? We're going to say one. And uh great, we have this
3:37:58
over here. I'm going to pin this data just for testing. Next, we have our if node. I'm going to zoom in a little bit
3:38:03
for you guys. First, we're going to take a look at our budget. We're going to say, is this budget, and it
3:38:09
automatically defaults for a number, and we're going to say is greater than, and maybe you don't want to take on
3:38:14
customers that are less than $1,000. Um, so we'll put a,000. And typically, a lot of people will put like round numbers
3:38:20
and things like that. So maybe you want to change this to greater than or equal to. And you'll see this goes into the
3:38:25
true branch. And maybe we don't want to deal with anything that goes into the false branch, right? And then next we'll
3:38:31
want to have some sort of switch. And maybe we have a different template we build out later on or, you know,
3:38:38
obviously this one is sending into the CRM, which you know, maybe we label based off of the company size. Again, there's a lot of different things we
3:38:44
could think about why we're using the switch based off of this company size, but I just want you guys to have some
3:38:50
testing with it. So, we're going to say value for company size. And we're going to do this probably by um let's just do
3:38:57
it three times. So, we'll three over here. So, drag in company size over here. And we'll do company size. And
3:39:04
we'll do small, medium, large. So, we'll go small, medium, large.
3:39:10
Call this small. Call this medium.
3:39:15
Call this large. Maybe you want to call this large company. Small company.
3:39:20
what is considered a small company? And actually, let's think about this. Um,
3:39:26
maybe if it's less than 20 employees. So, we're going to say 20 over here. And
3:39:32
instead of is equal to, we're going to say less than or equal to. Okay. Then
3:39:37
let's say medium. Maybe that's under 99 employees. So, we'll go over here.
3:39:42
Number we, we'll say less than or equal to 99. And then honestly instead of this
3:39:48
large, what we should do is probably remove that. We're going to go over here to add option. We'll fall back output
3:39:55
and think about it. Actually, we should keep large. We'll have a fallback output as well. And we'll still label this.
3:40:03
Just going to copy this expression in. And then we're going to say
3:40:10
value number is greater than 99.
3:40:16
Call this large and this is just in case someone sends us in bad data. We won't have our fallback over here. And uh
3:40:23
we'll say items will be sent to an extra separate output. And um
3:40:29
I think we're going to be good. And then we'll rename fallback output. Um we'll
3:40:34
say like missing size doesn't matter too much. But now if
3:40:41
we execute this workflow, you can see this populated into small. We go over here and we change this. And this is
3:40:47
what we can do for CH testing. Let's say we want to test these edge cases. We'll put 100 over here. You can see now it
3:40:55
goes to large. We go over here and change this out again. Sorry, I meant to
3:41:01
go to the form submission. We'll test that and uh do now is 50. Save that.
3:41:10
And you'll see it goes to medium. We could also go back over here and say, "Hey, Brian's SEO, they have $200 a
3:41:17
month. Are we going to do any services with them?" Nope. It goes into the false
3:41:22
branch. But now you know how if works in a world scenario as well as switch.
3:41:28
Again, very basic on this side of things. I just want to get your feet wet with it. The next one we're going to do
3:41:34
is a little bit of cleaning up data. So, let's just copy this note. and I
3:41:41
will go over here. Great. And let me just copy that I have in my notes. All
3:41:48
right. So, a workflow that processes contact list from multiple sources, removes duplicates, and then creates a
3:41:54
clean master list. So, let's go and build that out. How I want you to
3:42:03
build this out is first we're going to take in two edit fields.
3:42:12
fields. Then what we're going to do is expand that out. Expand these out. And you can
3:42:20
think of this edit twoit fields. And we're going to actually just populate arrays. So
3:42:25
populate arrays. We're going to expand both of these out.
3:42:31
Then we're going to append in our merge.
3:42:37
And then we're going to remove duplicates. So, I want you to build out this
3:42:42
workflow. We'll build it out here in a second. But again, pause the video. Try this for yourself.
3:42:49
Obviously, our edit fields are going to be a little bit different just based off of what we want to populate in there, but that's all right. All right, we're
3:42:55
back. Let's go and do that. I'm lazy. Actually, I'm not going to copy it. I'm just going to show you where edit fields
3:43:01
are. We're going to go over here and say edit fields. We're going to do that twice.
3:43:08
Why is that connected all the way over here? Look at that connection. That is
3:43:13
should have been lazy and just copied it. That's all right. Edit fields over here. Edit fields. Right. We need to
3:43:20
expand these out. If you remember from a little bit earlier, how do we do this? Well, we go to split out. So, just copy
3:43:27
split out. So, we'll split out twice.
3:43:32
Great. So, we have one split out. our second split out. Then we're going
3:43:38
to want to merge these together. So we're gonna go into our merge like that.
3:43:43
Awesome. Let's remove that. And then we're going to want to remove duplicates.
3:43:49
All right. Remove items process previous executions. No. Repeated with current input. Yep. So we're going to have our
3:43:55
clean list. This will go right here. This will go right here. And then let's find where our manual trigger is because
3:44:02
we know it has some issues. And this is going to be our workflow. Now, let's go in over here and we'll say names.
3:44:11
Duh. We'll change that into an array. And I'll just put Ryan
3:44:21
over here. Let's go Nolan.
3:44:26
Over here, we'll do another name. I'll put C. Crucial.
3:44:32
that. Great. And honestly, I'm just going to copy this. We're going to actually
3:44:37
replace this because I want to have some duplicates. Great.
3:44:43
Then over here, we'll change Ryan to Carlton. Keep Nolan and we'll put Maddox over
3:44:49
here. Awesome. So, we have those. Let's just test one of these edit fields. So,
3:44:55
that way we can just populate this for here. We'll call this names. Just super easy. Just execute this to make sure.
3:45:01
Great, that works. And obviously, like I like testing out each node at a time.
3:45:08
Great. We have our output there. We're going to merge these together. We're going to pin that. That's fine. So, I'm
3:45:14
going to run this up into this remove duplicates. Should have no issues. So, you have six names. Great. I'm going to
3:45:20
pin this data just for testing purposes. And then we go into remove duplicates. And uh we're going to do is compare all
3:45:27
fields. That's fine. Uh we can specify fields selected fields. Let's go over
3:45:32
here and choose names and we have five and take a look at
3:45:38
that. So we remove the extra I want to say there was an extra Ryan or extra
3:45:43
Nolan but we have Ryan Nolan Kershaw Carlton and Maddox. That is two more
3:45:49
workflows that we built together. If any of this did not make sense, I'd probably just pause the video, go back into that
3:45:56
specific node because this video is going to this video and honestly just
3:46:01
working with any and you're going to expand out and um really use these in workflows and if you don't understand
3:46:07
the basic fundamentals of these nodes, you're going to struggle and I don't
3:46:12
want to sound rude, but it's super important that you understand the basics. So yeah, those this is a longer section,
3:46:21
but to kind of recap, edit fields, we can create data in there. Uh we use it
3:46:27
often when we're using spreadsheets and we don't want all the specific fields or we have other things going in over here.
3:46:32
We can manipulate the JSON as well. If allows us to build out different
3:46:38
branches within our workflow, true, false, super basic, switch, you have multiple options associated with it. Uh
3:46:44
so you can think of a little bit kind of a more advanced if nodes. You can see for example I built out four. Filter
3:46:50
helps you clean up data. Limit is really good for testing. Date and time allow you to build out as it says date and
3:46:57
time. You can add in dates or additional days or hours or whatever else. You can remove it. You can format dates. You'll
3:47:05
use dates occasionally, but it's just important to know where it's at. Remove duplicates. Removes any duplicated data.
3:47:11
Some people don't want to have duplicated data. split out. It essentially takes an array and builds
3:47:17
out multiple items associated with it. Aggregates the opposite. It takes multiple items, turns that into an
3:47:22
array. Summarize allows us to do calculations such as like what's the average, what's the min, max, what's the
3:47:29
count. Um, and then also allows you to aggregate, but has a lot more functionality associated with it. Again,
3:47:35
I use summarize more than aggregate, my personal opinion. Merge, we have a ton of different options with merge. You can
3:47:42
append which essentially allows us to stack data. You could combine by position or you could combine by field.
3:47:48
If you combine by field, just know that there's multiple types of joins. Most popular one is just to keep only data
3:47:54
that matches together, which is your inner join. You have the inverse as well, which you can see things that weren't matched. And you either use the
3:48:00
left or right join to see those sides. Outer join shows you everything all together. And then we went through two
3:48:07
of these different examples. So hopefully that cleared up or I shouldn't
3:48:13
say clear up but hopefully you learned the basics of these nodes. You know we have one over one two three four five
3:48:20
six 7 8 9 10 in this section. Man that's a lot but uh we still have quite a more
3:48:26
that we're going to go through. Our next section actually is going to jump into data tables native data tables here in
3:48:32
Nan. uh one of the gamechanging things that the Nan team developed in 2012 2025
3:48:38
and uh we will take a look at that again feel free to take a break because this
3:48:44
uh section was very long I don't expect data tables to be as long as this but
3:48:49
yeah we'll definitely need to use it all right see you in section number eight all right so good job so far through the
3:48:56
course today we're going to be talking about data tables and what are data
3:49:01
tables well you can think of this as like a spreadsheet internal to any end. So instead of having to call let's say
3:49:09
air table or call Google sheets, you can have the data directly in any end and
3:49:15
you don't even need to import in a Google Sheets file. So what we're going to be doing is we're going to go over
3:49:20
how to access data tables. We're going to create a few different data tables as well and I believe we also have one or
3:49:25
two different small minor projects at the end of this lesson. So let's not waste any time and jump right into it.
3:49:33
Okay, so I'm over here in a new workflow and but I want to jump back into our
3:49:40
overview tab because that is going to be where the best place to access your data tables are. So I'm just going to click
3:49:47
overview like that and we're going to head over here. We're going to jump into
3:49:52
our fifth tab which is going to be data tables. And what we're going to do is we're going to create our first data
3:49:58
table together. And I'm just going to click this create table over here. And
3:50:04
then what we want to do is enter in a table name. You can either create something from scratch or you could
3:50:10
import in a CSV file. And your CSV file must contain a header row. Otherwise,
3:50:15
you need to define it. So I'm just going to click from scratch. We'll also create one from CSV here in a second. And I'm
3:50:22
going to say this is a running log. So like what my different runs are. Feel
3:50:28
free to use whatever examples you want and uh we're just going to generate this over here. There's also nodes on how we
3:50:34
could generate it, but we're going to start over here for running logs. I'm also going to create one from a CSV here
3:50:40
in a second, but let's start off with that. So, first thing you'll see is we have a created app by default as well as
3:50:47
updated at. So, these are going to be here originally. You also have an ID
3:50:54
which is your row number. Over here you have an add row section. You also have
3:51:00
an add column section. You also have a search over here too if you wanted to search for specific data. Uh this plus
3:51:08
icon allows you to add in additional columns. So row column, but you also
3:51:13
have these options over here. So what I want to do is add in a column. And we're going to go over here and say this is
3:51:20
miles. And you'll notice that we have different types available to us. We either have string, number, boolean, or
3:51:27
datetime. And I'm going to say miles is that over here. And we're going to add a column. And you'll see miles now is
3:51:35
populated over here. Now, let's say I want to add in a date. So, what we're
3:51:40
going to do is add in run dates. And we can go over here and choose our daytime.
3:51:48
So, we have now created miles, right? How many miles I ran, what day of the
3:51:54
run. Now, let's add in another column and we're going to say difficulty or let's say um is it a difficulty? We're
3:52:02
going to go and say location, whether it's like a a trail or a road or mountain, whatever the case may be.
3:52:09
There's no mountains in Florida, by the way. Uh we're going to go over here and add column.
3:52:14
And then lastly, what we're going to do is a boolean. And we can say like, I
3:52:20
don't know, spelt difficult.
3:52:26
And uh you know what? Actually, what we're going to do, I'm going to change our location. I'm going to delete this
3:52:31
column. And why I want to show you that is so we can delete stuff here as well. So I'm actually going to delete that.
3:52:37
And I'm thinking about, you know what, we should have a boolean instead of
3:52:42
roadr run. And this is either true or false, right? You ran on the road or you ran on the
3:52:49
trail. So, we're going to say this is a road run. And then lastly, we need to have a string. And then we're just going
3:52:56
to say run notes. And you know what? Actually, I want to
3:53:01
change run notes. I want to go over here and go and rename this column and say
3:53:06
runner notes. And obviously I'm making these mistakes on purpose or changes on purpose just to show you that we can
3:53:13
delete. We can change the name. We can also change the order like hey you know
3:53:19
what I want runner notes before road runner. I want this before the run date. Or actually you know what I want run
3:53:24
date first then miles runner notes road run. And you can change all these as you want. Again you can add in a column over
3:53:30
here if you wanted to or you could just um click on that side of things. There's also filters and things like that. and
3:53:37
we'll we'll cover that here in a second. But yeah, let's jump into adding our first thing. So, we're going to add in
3:53:44
today's run. And this is 1227 miles. I did 30 miles. Uh road run is
3:53:51
false because that over here like that. Yeah, it was old
3:53:57
trail running. Uh runner notes and we'll just say felt felt pretty good overall.
3:54:07
roll tested newer shoes on the trail. A bit dehydrated, which is
3:54:15
true because I'm kind of a little tired right now. Hydrated. And I probably misspelled dehydrated.
3:54:21
That was terrible spelling. That's fine. And you can see created at it says 12:27. We have a time stamp over here.
3:54:28
So, it is 6:21. And you can see that it's built over here at 6:20. And then
3:54:34
updated at as well. You can see it's uh 2056 which is essentially 621. And you
3:54:40
know we can change these if we want. There's nothing telling us we have to put this in general supposed to do 31
3:54:46
miles today but there is was on the trail and you know what 31 miles now? No. You know what I want to go back over
3:54:52
here and make it 30. Again you have the options to change that as you want. And
3:54:57
you can also see I can change the time. Well, you know I started running this morning at 6:00 a.m. And uh we can put
3:55:03
that over here. So you can see now it's at six. Well, actually, you know what? It's not at six. We started at 610. So,
3:55:11
what we're going to do is click okay. And we're going to change that over here to 610.
3:55:18
Boom. We have that over here. Obviously, there's more fields that I'd put in a run tracker or not. And you can keep
3:55:25
expanding that out. Another time earlier this week I I ran on I took a break the
3:55:32
last two days but I did run on Wednesday and on that day I ran specifically what
3:55:39
did I run eight miles want to say and that was a road run so we're going to
3:55:44
put over here and uh kind of felt really tired felt tired and it was a speed day
3:55:51
I don't like doing speed work but you can see we we changed this up as well when this created at time is different.
3:55:58
Updated at is different. You know what? I change this over here. Updated ad is going to change as well. Cool. So, next
3:56:06
what we can do is add in different types of filters and take a look at it from that perspective. So, if I wanted to go
3:56:12
over here and hey, you know what? I only want to take a look at things that were not uh road runs. I can go over here,
3:56:18
false. You know what? I want to actually show anything that was at a road run. That is true. You know what? I want to
3:56:24
just remove the filter. it goes to both U. And these are going to always be different because you can see like this
3:56:30
is a boolean miles over here. We can choose our different options. These
3:56:35
options are going to be very similar to what we've already covered with our if node or our filter node. You can see we
3:56:41
have equals, does not equal, less than, greater than, greater than, greater than equal to, between, is null. And maybe I
3:56:47
want to see anything that's like larger than a marathon. So I say like 26.2.
3:56:52
Um actually it should be just greater than so greater than 22 over there or
3:56:58
you know what I want to see between anything 26.2 to 100 miles 100 miles is
3:57:04
a very common ultra and you can see we saw that one over there. So you know what I want to find things that are less
3:57:09
than a marathon 8 miles over here. All right so again those are some of the different options over here and uh yeah
3:57:16
so we also have this option for dates. You can see we have equals, is not equal, less than, less than, equal,
3:57:22
greater than, greater than equal to, between, is null, is not null. We have our runner notes which we can filter. So
3:57:28
you have something that contains and maybe want to search for things that are tired. Also, let me remove this filter.
3:57:35
And I don't know why this filter is not working. There we go. Reset. You
3:57:42
would think it would be easier just to click on and off, but let's say I want to filter for anything that says tired.
3:57:47
So I'm just going to go search tired over here. And you see tired shows. I am curious if it is case sensitive or not.
3:57:55
It is not case sensitive which is great. But that's contained. You have equals. Obviously the full thing needs a match.
3:58:00
Does not equal is empty not empty not old. And then you have other things for when a no specific row is created
3:58:08
or last updated at. Okay. I'm going to reset this over here. You get the gist of essentially how this works. uh
3:58:16
directly in this view. However, we can do a lot of modifications as well uh directly within any end. I also just
3:58:23
want to show you really fast uploading a CSV file because that is something that has been recently added to data tables.
3:58:29
People have requested it. So, I'm going to find a CSV file really fast and then
3:58:35
uh we're going to upload that. Actually, I won't even need to find one or create a new uh CSV file because if you click
3:58:42
these three dots, I forgot to show you. We can rename uh we can just change this first to runner logs. Okay. Then what we
3:58:50
can do over here is delete, which I'm not going to delete this yet, but I'm going to download the CSV first. So you can see we have runner logs.csv.
3:58:56
And I'm going to delete this over here. Delete. Now we go to data tables. I'm going to say create new data table.
3:59:02
Import CSV. And I'm going to grab my runner logs. Then I'm just going to drag that in over here. My CSV contains a
3:59:09
header row, which I assume it does. Uh uh.
3:59:15
Oh, I need to put in a name. I was like I would have thought it would have just kept the exact name. That's all right.
3:59:20
We're going to create this over here. Log CSV been uploaded. We found seven columns and two rows. Column name, which
3:59:28
is interesting. You can't use the default ones if you
3:59:33
just download this one over here. So,
3:59:39
and you can't I guess you also can't just change this
3:59:45
as well. I'm just going to call these ID2 and things like that. Yeah, this is my first time literally looking at the
3:59:51
new updates over here. Um, all right. So,
3:59:57
cool. So, I'm just going to say this is created at two and then ID2.
4:00:02
I wish if you had the same column names like for ID and then updated at and created at it would just automatically
4:00:09
populate those. So like that should be edited and maybe it will in the future.
4:00:14
All right, so we have all those. I'm just going to create this really fast and then you can see we have these over here. I would just recommend you delete
4:00:21
this ID2 for putting that in. And then you have these created and updated out. And
4:00:27
obviously you can't modify these but yeah. So these unfortunately are
4:00:33
going to have to go as well. So you won't see exactly when these were created at or updated at, which is a
4:00:39
bummer. You can't upload that within a CSV, but we essentially have the same runner log that we had before. All
4:00:46
right, so now let's talk about the nodes here in any. Hopefully that cleared up any confusion. Again, you can add row,
4:00:53
add column, created is when you add in that row, updated as last modification.
4:00:58
You can move these around. Make sure to get your data type correct because you cannot change it. You can change the
4:01:04
column name and you can also delete a column as necessary. Uh multiple options. Add a column here, add column
4:01:12
there, add a row here, add rows. All right. So now let's talk about data tables in general. And uh what we'll see
4:01:19
is we have data table and it's a recommended node. Uh so what we're going to do is take a look at our data table
4:01:26
and we have delete rows, get rows, if row exists, if row does not exist, insert row, update rows, and upsert
4:01:32
rows. Now I am going to say I believe here in the future and I I saw a note
4:01:37
from the Nan team that there's going to be like a a create data table option as
4:01:43
part of the node. I could be wrong, but I believe I did see that they were going to populate that soon. So depending when
4:01:51
you're watching this video that should be out. Um we're just going to go and take a look at some of these options. I
4:01:58
guess we can't Oh, let me go to operations. Yeah. So we have all the different stuff over here. Let's just go
4:02:04
into these. So first thing you have is resource. This one's just based off of rows over here. There's no
4:02:11
option yet to update columns, which I would think that there's going to be a node option for that in the future, but
4:02:17
you can see rows, row, row, row. Um, they obviously put this in here, so you could have columns here in the future.
4:02:23
Again, I I don't know the full in development, but I would assume it's going to come at some time in the
4:02:29
future. This one will delete a specific row. You could get rows if a row exists,
4:02:34
match input items that are in data table, match input items that are not in the data table, insert a new row,
4:02:39
update, upsert as well. So, let me just show you a few of these really fast. So, what we can do is get row um you have to
4:02:47
find your data table. So, you just go over here and search for your table. If you're not sure what the table looks
4:02:52
like, you see this icon? This actually opens up your data table here into the side. And now we have that populated
4:02:58
over there. So, I'm just going to do runner logs. Uh what we're going to do is match any condition, but you can also
4:03:03
match all conditions. I don't have any filters over here. I'll show you some filters in a second. You can also return
4:03:09
all the data or you could limit it based off the results. And why they have that is any end tends to lag if you have a
4:03:16
ton of data. Data tables can be pretty large. Obviously, I only put two rows in there. So, you'll see if I execute this,
4:03:22
we have all this information. But, you know what? Maybe I just want to limit this to one row. And you see now we only
4:03:28
have one row. It says limit is not. There may be more items returned. Tweak the return all. I'm just going to return
4:03:34
all. But now what we're going to do is match a condition. And what we're going to do is take a look at miles. And we're
4:03:40
going to say if miles equals 30. So let me want to just find all the runs that are 30 miles. And boom, we have this
4:03:47
over here. And you can see that this is defined as a zero. If we go back into
4:03:52
our data table. Oh, you know what? This actually didn't pick up the boolean value. If you take a look at this
4:03:58
earlier, we had this as boolean and let's say road running and
4:04:08
we'll just go back over here and make this a boolean column. That's another thing I did not even notice. Um, that's
4:04:15
interesting. All right, we're just going to delete that over here. So, another thing to
4:04:22
mention if you are working on this
4:04:27
sure to change your booleans because it might not always be correct. Going back over here, I'm just going to execute the
4:04:33
step again. And you can see this is turned into false. That is interesting. I feel like that's another bug. Um,
4:04:39
obviously the software just pro or not software, but the team has made some changes. So maybe that was something
4:04:45
they didn't address. But regardless, you can see now it is false. Over here I can change our different conditions. We can
4:04:52
go to another column. Let's go into road running. as a boolean and you can see is true. I
4:04:58
just want to show whatever is a road run and you can see that is true. Obviously there's more things we can take a look at if we really wanted to. Uh and this
4:05:06
could be way longer. Obviously you can delete a row which would just completely get rid of it from our data table. I
4:05:11
don't want to do that because I already spent enough time building that out and you can insert a new row. So let me just
4:05:17
show you how to insert this in really fast. Let's say I am going to run another thing over here. I actually ran
4:05:24
a half marathon though half in Orlando. So I will say that half marathon's
4:05:30
nothing by the way. That's only 13 miles and that is a road running runner notes.
4:05:36
Felt great. Didn't really feel great. I kind of cramped a little bit but I put
4:05:41
that over here. You can see this has been updated the 13th. We have a time which I could put in the exact time if I
4:05:47
really wanted to. But now if I go and get rows, you can see this is now
4:05:53
populated in over there, which is awesome. And you know, we can sort these results as well. And I wanted to cover
4:06:01
this node in this area. So let's say you have a a spreadsheet and you want to
4:06:06
sort these. You can go over here to sort and changes the the order of items. So
4:06:12
we have three items, which is the each row is a specific item in a spreadsheet.
4:06:17
And I want to sort these now by run date. So I go over here to sort and I'm
4:06:24
going to do a simple sort. There's other options as well. You could sort by code. You could sort random also by code. I
4:06:29
believe it's only JavaScript now. Yeah, they need to put Python in here. Um JavaScript, but we'll do a simple sort.
4:06:37
Add fields of sort by. We're going to go and grab our run date. And we're going to put this in ascending order which is
4:06:42
A to Z or earliest or smallest number to largest in this case like earliest date.
4:06:49
And you'll see that has changed uh 1213. 1224. You know what? I don't want to do
4:06:55
run date. I want to take a look at miles. Do this in ascending order. You can see it goes from small to large. You
4:07:00
know what? I want descending order. You can see it goes from 30 into eight. Again, we can change this as well for
4:07:08
other things, but I think it's pretty self-explanatory. There you have other options over here. Disablenotation, but
4:07:14
that's really it. And you can sort by multiple fields if there is things that are tied. So, typically if there's a
4:07:21
tiebreaker, you'll want to have a secondary sort. Very, very common in the real world. I can tell you that because
4:07:27
I pull a lot of data from SQL databases and there's a lot of sorting. You can sort by random as well. Um, this can
4:07:33
randomly generate your data. So you can see it's changing every time that I run it. So if you need to have any sort of
4:07:39
randomization, maybe you want to go with this approach. Although the one downside is this is not replicatable. You just
4:07:46
don't have that specific seed number if you want to get it randomized. But yeah,
4:07:51
that is essentially a sort. I just wanted to throw this in over here really fast. This was something I was going to
4:07:56
throw within the data tables or like Google Sheets, but I felt like it was pretty applicable. Now, so again,
4:08:03
go into data tables and create a table. In the future, the end team is going to be building this into a native node. Um,
4:08:10
I thought it was going to be out by now, but it's not. And you can create a table from there. You can also create a table
4:08:17
from scratch or you could upload a CSV, although it seems like the CSV functionality is down just a little bit.
4:08:23
Again, it's a small bug. Uh, data table node over here is based off of rows. Right now you can get rows, delete rows,
4:08:30
update rows as well, upsert and different things like that. You have options to return everything or limit
4:08:36
it. So that way uh your N instance doesn't bug out if you have a ton of data. And that essentially is data
4:08:44
tables. I want to jump into our projects now for this section. Obviously, we we
4:08:49
don't have a ton going on on the node side of things. obviously give you guys
4:08:54
the spreadsheet that I used, but let's talk about two projects. And what we'll
4:09:01
do first is add in project number one. I'm just going to grab this from my notes, which is on our second screen.
4:09:08
Great. So, this project today, what we're going to take a look at is a birthday emailer. So, imagine you have a
4:09:14
a schedule that takes a look at your table on like a daily basis or runs the operation on a daily basis. you filter
4:09:21
for today's birthday. And I say send a personalized email. Obviously, I haven't shown you guys how to send a personal
4:09:27
email yet. So, we could ignore that section. Although, if you want to try doing it, awesome. And this is pretty
4:09:33
basic. So, spend a few minutes, try to see if you could do that. Try to throw also a different trigger just to start
4:09:38
this workflow for you guys. And uh yeah, pause the video. Three, two, one, and
4:09:45
let's take a look at it. All right, I'm back. Let's build this out. So, first what we should do is create a new data
4:09:51
table. And what we're going to do is call this birthday. And we'll create this. And we're just
4:09:58
going to go and add a column. And we're going to say this is birthday. And it's
4:10:03
going to be specifically a datetime over here. Awesome. And what we're going to
4:10:10
do first is also create another name. And we're say like employee name.
4:10:16
And oh that's another thing I forgot to bring in this video. You can't have spaces. You can see it says invalid column name. So if you want to have
4:10:24
space essentially do an underscore. So we'll say like employee name. Obviously there's database principles associated
4:10:29
with this in database. You should not have a space in your column name. All right. So we're going to go over here.
4:10:34
We're going to say someone has a birthday of today. Employee name. Um I I click cards. So,
4:10:42
the first card that I have over here just to show you like from 1986 Fleer. Um, put his name in over here. Danny.
4:10:49
So, see Danny Sanjay. I completely butchered that. I
4:10:55
clicked mostly baseball cards, not basketball, but that was on my stack.
4:11:01
Cool. So, we have that over here. And then we'll create another row over here.
4:11:06
Let's grab a baseball card. This is Derek Jeter. We'll throw Derek Jeter in
4:11:11
over here. Obviously, I could look up their birthdays or just grab it from the back of the card, but I'm not going to
4:11:17
do that. We're gonna say Derek Jeter has a birthday of And we're just going to go
4:11:23
Oh, sorry. And obviously, I'm looking at 2025. I should put actual days over
4:11:31
here, but it does not matter. I mean, it does matter, but we're just going to literally filter by month and
4:11:38
day. Cool. So we have both of those over here. I think this is fine and let's
4:11:43
jump into it. So first thing we want to do is go over here. We're going to look for a trigger. So let's go into our
4:11:50
triggers. So we should go over here and then we say on a schedule. So we have
4:11:55
this. The first thing we need to do is take a look at a trigger interval. We'll
4:12:01
say this runs at every day. We could choose a specific hour. Let's say this
4:12:06
runs every day at like 8 a.m. or 9:00 a.m. when a workplace starts. A little bit on my view because of the mic, but
4:12:13
that's okay. Then what we're going to do is get rows. So we'll go into our data table, data table, and what we're going
4:12:21
to do is get rows. I first want to just make sure that we can pull all of our data. So I'm just going to go into
4:12:27
birthday. And we're going to execute this step. And you can see now that
4:12:32
specifically works. And let's we might actually have to pull the data over here and add in another filter into the next
4:12:39
node, but I'm just going to double check. So, we can add in a condition. We're going to look at birthday over
4:12:44
here. And yeah, so we can say it's equal to something.
4:12:50
Um, wonder if we can actually make an expression, but we might be able to make an
4:12:56
expression. I'm going to actually pause the video and show you really fast how we could do this.
4:13:02
All right, I'm back. Here is the other part of the solution. So, I tried to get this working down in the conditions.
4:13:09
Since it's a little bit more complicated, I decided, hey, let's pull all of our data over here and let's
4:13:15
actually use a node after to filter. I'm not ashamed of that. Next thing, what I did is I essentially was trying to grab
4:13:22
an expression uh to just grab the month and date. Here's the deal with it. I'm
4:13:28
not going to memorize all the different patterns for month and date and time and
4:13:35
all this stuff. LMS are pretty good at this if you want to prompt it. So you can see what it did is it said datetime
4:13:41
from JSON. To format month month day day from the daytime now to format month
4:13:48
month day. probably could have easily figured this out over here as well as this if I put a little bit more effort into it, but and I'll show you also what
4:13:55
I prompted, but you can see kept the one item. So, we kept the birthday over here that I said was 12:27. It does have that
4:14:01
time stamp, but you know what? It still matched specifically what today is. And
4:14:07
uh yeah, we can send a personalized message after. And you know, we could
4:14:12
actually build that out with an AI agent. Obviously, you guys know a little bit of the basics. And what I'll do is
4:14:18
put this over here. We'll add in a chat model. We'll go in here and add in what
4:14:24
are we going to add? We'll add in tropic for this one. Great. And then all I'm going to say is go here and say write a
4:14:34
unique birthday
4:14:40
message for our employee. Let's pretend these are employees. And we'll put over here
4:14:49
his birthday is his birthday is and we'll go over here json.now
4:14:58
not JSON.now sorry it's uh we're going back over not this one it is
4:15:04
datetime.now see I make mistakes as well
4:15:10
datetime.now Now good. Great. So we have this information. Let's write this. You
4:15:18
know what? This is probably going to be a little bit weird because it might think it's birthday is 2025
4:15:23
is the month month day. It's the month
4:15:28
and day from that's a little bit better. We haven't obviously talked about prompts and this is a pretty bad prompt.
4:15:35
But let's write this and uh we'll get the birthday message as well based on the date. Here you go. Happy birthday
4:15:42
Danny. Wishing you a fantastic December 23rd. Hope your day is special joy, relaxation, all your favorite things.
4:15:47
And it's sounds straight up from HR. And here you go. Your team company name. Cool. So, we're able to build this out
4:15:54
the nuance um based off the filtering of the dates. I just found it easier to throw this in the filter side of it. And
4:16:01
again, just to show you how I prompted this, which I don't believe I showed it to you. If I did, I I apologize. I said,
4:16:07
"And can you write me an expression? I want to have it grab the birthday matches this." So, I initially sent in this screenshot. Obviously, that didn't
4:16:14
work. So, I continue to prompt it. And then I sent what this looked like based off of the the code that they gave us
4:16:21
for each of these across the board showing that the time stamp over here. And this also had a different result.
4:16:28
And then it gave me both of those. and uh should give you that which is 100%
4:16:33
correct because that is what I got. And again, we filtered out Derek Jeter because apparently he was born 107.
4:16:41
Hopefully you guys enjoyed that example. What we're going to do next is do
4:16:47
another data table. And what we're going to do, this one's
4:16:53
actually a little bit easier. Maybe we should have started with this. Cool. So, we're doing a product
4:16:59
inventory tracker. So, let's say we have data table for different products. We want to schedule some sort of check.
4:17:06
Maybe this isn't a daily check, but uh we're going to do a weekly check. So, weekly
4:17:13
check. And then we're going to say if low stock, we'll say like less than five items, then five items, we're going to
4:17:21
do an email alert, which again, I haven't shown you an email alert yet, but can ignore that section. and uh we
4:17:28
can do still the first parts of it. So let's spend a few minutes, you try to
4:17:33
solve it first and then I will give you guys the solution. All right, ready? 3 2
4:17:38
1 Let's get that. All right, we're back. Let's solve this. So first thing we need to do is create
4:17:44
that data table. And we're just going to say we're going to say inventory as our
4:17:49
table name. We're going to just keep this super busy easy. I'm gonna say items and what we're
4:17:57
going to do is say stock. Obviously, in real database, there's a
4:18:02
lot better designs and things like that, but uh let's add in some items. So, we'll say Hoka Speed Goats,
4:18:09
which I've never ran in, but I've heard great things about. Let's say the stock on these are 20. And then we'll go over
4:18:16
here and we'll add in Nike Alphally. Obflies. We'll keep that misspelling.
4:18:24
And the inventory is two. Great. And what we're going to do is build this
4:18:29
out. So, first thing we're going to do is a schedule trigger. So, we have the schedule trigger over here. This time we
4:18:35
set a weekly check. So, just go in over here and change this into weeks. We can choose the day. Let's maybe make this as
4:18:41
like a Monday morning. So, that way it can be on the task for an employee. We'll say 8:00 a.m. We can say also
4:18:48
minute. Let's put this to 30 minutes like 8:30. Then what we're going to do is grab our data table. So we're going
4:18:53
to go to data table like that. And we're going to say get rows. And we're going
4:18:59
to go over here and choose inventory. And we're going to add in a condition directly over here. So we're going to look at stock. And we're going to say
4:19:06
stock is less than or equal to five. That's a low. And boom. We have that
4:19:12
right over there. Literally two nodes. Now we have a trigger that goes and runs
4:19:17
this on weekly cadence and then we get the rows from our database and obviously we could schedule an email and things
4:19:23
like that a little bit later. Uh that is coming though because I'm going to be showing you guys how we could set up Gmail and just a few different sections
4:19:30
so we can really expand these out. And honestly if you want to go backwards later on the course and expand these out
4:19:35
that's perfectly fine. These are going to all be saved as JSON files so you guys can access them. And that is data
4:19:44
tables. Obviously, I should have probably put this one here first rather than this one. But the day just wanted
4:19:50
to show you two use cases. Thank you for uh checking this one out. And I will see
4:19:56
you guys in section number nine. Now, all right. So, we're now going to cover something called binary files. And
4:20:03
binary files seem really scary, but they're really not. It's really any type of file that you want to pass along your
4:20:10
workflow. There's some weird quirks about binary files in comparison to the things that we've covered so far. And
4:20:18
I'm also going to teach you about two new nodes in this section which I think will be pretty helpful for you to learn.
4:20:25
I didn't want to put them in the common node section because they really pair well with binary files. So we're going
4:20:32
to jump into NE right now and let's uh learn a little bit more about binary files. Okay. So, first, you know, the
4:20:41
easiest way to start working with binary files is honestly a form trigger. So, we're going to go and grab on form
4:20:47
submission. And you'll see we have this right over here. Okay. And what we're going to just call this on the side of
4:20:54
things is file uploader. And uh we're going to add in a form element. So, I'm
4:21:01
just going to call this field name data. And I say upload file.
4:21:07
And what we're going to do is change our element type. So this is brand new. And
4:21:14
you know, we've covered a lot of these, but this time we have something called file. And you could accept either one
4:21:20
file or multiple files. For simplicity sake in this video, we're just going to do a single file. You could also specify
4:21:28
the specific file type. If you're going to go into production, highly, highly recommend you define what file types
4:21:35
that you want in over here. Right now, since I am going to be giving you guys
4:21:40
this through multiple examples, I'm just going to leave it blank. So, we have our form. And if you go and execute the
4:21:46
step, you'll see it says choose file, which is great. So, we're going to go
4:21:52
through this as an example and we're going to go and upload our CSV file, the
4:21:57
runner logs that we just used. You can see I just drag and drop this or you could choose a file on your computer.
4:22:03
And I'm going to click submit. And look at this. Wait, we have our fourth
4:22:10
option. So, we've covered schema, table, and JSON. And now we have this section
4:22:16
over here that has a binary file. The field name will be populated here at the
4:22:22
top. And you can see file name is runner logs.csv. It has our file extension over here. And
4:22:30
we can actually view our file and download it view. We'll go and do that over here. And it downloads that as a
4:22:37
file. Uh when you view an image, it'll actually show over here. So I want to
4:22:42
just show you that as an example as well. Let me actually grab a image
4:22:48
and uh throw that in. All right. So I'm going to execute this step. I have just
4:22:53
this running image. Believe we used it in uh a YouTube video or just some testing purposes. And I click submit.
4:23:02
And you see if I click view, we actually have an image that populates over here, which is cool because if you do any sort
4:23:09
of image editing or image manipulation, uh you can just preview it on that side of things. And again, I could download
4:23:15
this as well. This time it's a PNG file and you can see PNG has been uploaded over there on that. So I want to execute
4:23:23
this step one more time and we're going to actually just go back and throw in the CSV file. We're going to go to
4:23:29
images a little bit later and we'll click submit. And you'll see oh I actually upload the
4:23:35
wrong one and we click submit and you can see we have our CSV file here once again. Okay so we showed you that this
4:23:43
is the fourth type over here and you'll see this with other stuff as well. First thing I want to do is show you how we
4:23:49
can actually extract our information because you might have uploaded a CSV or someone uploads a CSV and you're like
4:23:55
how do I actually grab this data out? So you can go over here and say extract from file. And it says convert binary
4:24:02
data into JSON. And you can see we have a lot of different options over here. So
4:24:07
you want to match this based around the file that you're using. And I'm going to show you also just a a quick pipeline.
4:24:14
If you're working with like CSV files, how we could also approach this or CSV or Excel files. We're going to just say
4:24:20
extract from CSV. You have input binary field name. Make sure whatever is here
4:24:26
matches over here. I called this data. So it's one two one. You're not matching on file name. You're matching on
4:24:33
whatever this is called. This is called data over here. Again, we define this as
4:24:38
the field name. So our field name needs to match what it says input binary field. So that is at the very top. I
4:24:45
know when I first started working with binary files, I always thought it was like this. I just could not get it to work. So make sure it's that field
4:24:51
image. So if I execute the step, we have all of our data. You can see table. we
4:24:56
have our table that's been extracted from a CSV file. Then what we can do as
4:25:01
well is use an edit and say edit fields like this.
4:25:09
And what we can do now is go over here and choose what fields we
4:25:15
want. Now I don't care about the ID. Maybe I just want to have the run date,
4:25:20
miles, and whether it was a road run or not. And look, we've just populated these
4:25:27
three and we have all this over here. And this is one of the ways I use edit fields all the time. I alluded to it a
4:25:32
little bit earlier in uh this video or this course, however you want to define it. But edit fields allows you to really
4:25:40
clean things up because now I don't have all this junk. I just have these three over here. So now I want to show you the
4:25:47
opposite of extract from file and show you to convert to file. So convert to
4:25:53
file will take our JSON data and turn it into binary data. And we could define
4:25:58
hey we want to turn this into a CSV, HTML, ICS, JSON, ODS, RTF, text file,
4:26:03
XLS, XLSX. Like you can choose whatever you want. Let's say I want an Excel file. We're going to call this data over
4:26:10
here. And I execute the step. And now we have created a binary file. So we have
4:26:17
the option over here to extract from our binary file. You can see extract from CSV, HTML, etc. And then we have the
4:26:25
option over here to convert back into a file. And why this is really cool, if
4:26:31
you go back to some of our other previous examples, like we could have used this convert to file in multiple
4:26:37
different ways. So now we know if like, hey, we end off with some sort of JSON.
4:26:42
We can turn this into a spreadsheet and then we could attach this spreadsheet
4:26:47
into an email. And again there's a lot of different opportunities out there but uh extract from file grabs from a binary
4:26:54
file. You have to define the file type and then convert the file converts it to
4:27:00
a specific file type. And again you could download this right over here. You could also essentially take this file
4:27:07
and move it up into Google Drive. There's a there's a really a lot of different options for you. So I showed
4:27:14
you how to download it. I showed you that. Let me show you as well working with binary data because it it can be
4:27:20
weird in your workflows. So what I want to show you is this note and I just save
4:27:27
this all the time and I access it because it can be confusing. Like if let's imagine you have a binary file a
4:27:33
little bit earlier in workflow and then you do some other data manipulations or uh have other nodes and you want to
4:27:38
access this binary file again. How do you actually access the binary file? So, what I'm going to do is just copy this
4:27:44
and literally just going to be called on form submission one. And let's imagine we have two edit fields. So, I'm going
4:27:51
to go over here and say edit fields. And then maybe I want to go and have another
4:27:56
edit fields after. I don't know. We're just going to go and make some weird stuff happen over here. All right. So,
4:28:02
we have two edit fields. Put like name.
4:28:07
We're going to say I don't know. Keep chugging. Keep chugging. Cool. And uh
4:28:13
let's say we want to access this binary file later in edit fields. So I'm going to go over here. I'm going to go and
4:28:20
execute this workflow. We are going to access a image. I'm going to go find
4:28:25
another image for you guys. Okay. So now I want to share with you guys how we can
4:28:30
actually access binary data a little bit later on in a workflow. So from the
4:28:36
example above over here, if I execute this workflow again, and I upload a
4:28:41
file, which I'll just grab our runner logs again and upload this over here, you'll notice that if we go to the edit
4:28:48
fields, we no longer see the binary file. Um, we only have schema, table, and JSON. However, when you go to
4:28:55
extract from file, you'll have u our data, which is our binary file on this
4:29:00
side of things. You're like, all right, how do I actually access this? And let me show you how we could do this. So
4:29:08
here's how this code works. And I'm just going to make this a little bit more clear. So essentially what we want to do
4:29:16
is define the node where the binary data is at. In this case it's the form
4:29:22
submission which is our trigger. And uh so I just put that as node but node or
4:29:27
trigger. We do do item.binary and then the name of the file. So not name of the
4:29:33
file but the field name. So you can see over here the field name is data. So in this case when I duplicate this we're
4:29:40
going to say on form submission one because we're going to get a second version of this do item.binary
4:29:46
data. Again if this is something else let's say it's like file you just change file in right over here. You say
4:29:54
spreadsheet right there. You change this over here to spreadsheet. So we'll do that really quick. I'm going to make a
4:30:01
one modification over here. So hopefully you guys don't mind. So I'm just going to go over here
4:30:07
and just put a limit because it's going to duplicate my binary files if I don't. And I'm just going to put a limit of
4:30:13
one. So let's just go there. Great. And then I'm going to add in an edit fields. And I'm also going to show you really
4:30:19
quick how edit fields works with the binary file. So what we're going to do is grab our code side things. And you'll
4:30:27
notice the curly braces brackets. So that's going to be a expression. So
4:30:33
we'll go over here and automatically changes to an expression. Instead of string this time, we want to go into binary data. And by default, we can keep
4:30:41
our name. I'll just keep a data, but I'll show you we can we can change it as well. So let's run this workflow.
4:30:46
Execute step. I'm going to run in put in my runner logs over here. I'll click submit. And you'll see we have the green
4:30:52
check. And we have our binary data once back again. So again, how you access this is we we're node has the binary
4:31:01
file, the item.binary, and then the file name. But hey, what if we don't like data? I want to name this to
4:31:07
spreadsheet. Well, that's one of the cool things with uh edit set. So I can go over here and call this spreadsheet.
4:31:14
Now I execute this step. And now if I want to access this later on, it's just called spreadsheet. Again, you can view
4:31:20
or download this. Same thing is applicable to images as well. So hopefully that clears up how to access
4:31:27
it later. Remember the node that the file is at the item.binary and then also the binary name. Okay, next thing and
4:31:35
this is a little bit outside the scope of binary data but I'm still going to throw it into this section and this is
4:31:42
converting a file uh from base 64. So a little bit weird but yeah, let me show
4:31:49
you how we could specifically do that. Okay. So, how we're going to do this, we're going to start with a manual
4:31:54
trigger. So, I'm going to go over here to a manual trigger. And next thing we're going to do is do an edit fields.
4:32:02
So, we're going to go edit fields and we'll grab that. Awesome. So, now we have our edit fields over here. Next
4:32:08
thing we want to do is grab a base 64 image encoder. The website I'm using for this encoding. And I'll just put this as
4:32:14
a sticky note for you guys so you can see it just because I believe I have my browser tabs cut off. So go to this
4:32:21
website, b64 image.de. So all we want to do is drag and drop an image over here.
4:32:27
And what I'm going to do is just grab a recent screenshot that I had. And inside over here, I just have an image from
4:32:34
kind of a YouTube video I was watching. I thought it'd be kind of interesting to
4:32:40
at least save this on my computer. So over here, you'll see now that we have all of this code associated with it. And
4:32:47
that is a lot of code all the way down over here. Wow, that is a ton. And it
4:32:54
says for image elements. And essentially what this is is this is code for this
4:33:00
particular image. I can't tell you the math behind it. I never really researched that. But all this can turn
4:33:08
into an image. So what I want to do is grab all of this minus the first part
4:33:13
because we don't care about data, image, PNG, B 64. We just want this very long
4:33:19
string. And all I'm going to do is go over here to manual mapping and we're going to label that. And how we want to
4:33:26
label this, we're just going to call this as image. So image like this. We're going to keep it a string. And we're going to paste in that very long value.
4:33:33
And again, if you want to make sure it works correctly, open this up. And you'll see this is all of the base 64.
4:33:40
That is it's insane for an image. Okay. So, if we execute this step, you'll see
4:33:45
we just have that over here. Like the craziness. Now, the next thing we're
4:33:51
going to do is go back into convert to file. So, search for convert to file and
4:33:56
we're going to turn this into an image. And you can see it says move B 64 string to file. So, now what we're going to do
4:34:04
is go over here on that side of things. We're gonna say B 64 input field. We
4:34:10
call this image. So make sure we put this is image and then we could change the output file name as I showed you
4:34:15
like we change it from data to spreadsheets. It's commonly called data. I'm just going to call this video
4:34:20
screenshot. So video screenshot and change it to how you would like and
4:34:26
hopefully that this works. We're going to execute step. Oh, look at that. And now I can view this. Boom. This is from
4:34:34
a school live stream or school video. And you can see um we have 101.8% 8%
4:34:40
retention which is not accurate but uh yeah we have this screenshot and it worked correctly. So essentially what we
4:34:47
did is we encoded this image I used a B 64 coder and we got all of the string
4:34:54
associated with it. Then we put this into our edit fields as an image name.
4:34:59
Uh we just called this a string or not called this a string but put this as data type of string. Pasted that in over
4:35:04
here and then we converted that B64 string into a particular image. So I
4:35:10
know their approach that sometimes you'll see is people want to have an image as B 64 and then convert it a
4:35:15
little bit later on. So now that's like the basics. I want to give you guys an
4:35:21
example workflow working with binary files. And here is going to be your mini
4:35:27
project on this side of things. This is going to be a little bit abstract. And obviously there's other things I
4:35:32
want to do with B 64, but we haven't really covered OC or not B 64, but sorry, binary files, but we really
4:35:38
haven't covered OCR yet, and that'll be a little bit later on in this course. So, what we're going to do is we're
4:35:44
going to have a form upload. We're going to download the attachment. We're going to remove extra columns from it. We're
4:35:50
going to remove duplicate uh issues. I put billing, but maybe we're going to do
4:35:55
like a billing spreadsheet. add in one data point as it from a merge and then save as a brand new CSV. So, let me give
4:36:02
you a little bit of context. What we're going to do on this side of things is we're going to have like a billing
4:36:08
file uploader uploader and we have just name
4:36:14
and we'll say we'll pretend like the name is unique. This is unique. So, each
4:36:19
name cannot be built multiple times and then we'll have like a a cost. So let's
4:36:25
just say like this is a dollar amount in integers. It's I just want to keep it
4:36:31
super basic. So we upload a spreadsheet. We download the attachments associated
4:36:38
with it. Right? Once we go through over here, remove any extra columns. So let's add an extra column as well. Um extra
4:36:45
column. Let's think about what we're going to say. Um let's do something way out there. Does not make sense to put in
4:36:52
billing. favorite color, right? Uh we're going to remove the duplicate billing issues as well. So,
4:36:58
we're going to have one person that's duplicated. We're going to have a merge to add in another data point. Let's say the spreadsheet was missing one row.
4:37:05
We're going to have another edit set. We're going to bring that in over here and we're going to save as a new CSV.
4:37:11
So, I want you guys to kind of test this out and see if you can get the solution
4:37:18
and pause the video. Ready? Three, two, one, pause it and I will be right back with the solution. All right, guys. I'm
4:37:25
back. So, let's build this out. First, I don't even have the spreadsheet yet, but
4:37:30
we're just going to build out this workflow. So, what I want to do is go to a form. So, we're going to say any end
4:37:35
form. We're going to go to a trigger and do on a new form event. So, this is going to upload our our spreadsheet.
4:37:42
Next thing that we want to do is ract our spreadsheet. So extract from file
4:37:47
and we're going to extract from a CSV. Great. And obviously I'm not connecting these yet. We need to remove extra
4:37:54
columns. Well, I showed you how to do this through edit set. So we can put edit set for here as well. Great. Next,
4:38:01
what we want to do is remove duplicate billing issues. So we're going to go to remove duplicates for here. And we're
4:38:08
going to remove within the current input. Okay. Then what we're going to do is add
4:38:14
in one more data point from a merge. So we're going to get another edit set.
4:38:19
And again, I'll show you how to put everything together here in a minute. Then we need to merge in everything
4:38:25
together. So we're going to say merge. And uh the merge will take in those
4:38:30
inputs. And then lastly, we want to convert to a file. So we're going to say convert to file.
4:38:37
And let's convert this back into a CSV. Great. So, let's actually build out our
4:38:43
spreadsheet. And what I'm going to do is just go into personal and I'm going to create a just very quick data table. And
4:38:50
obviously, like you can call the data table in here instead of uploading a spreadsheet, but I'm just going to do
4:38:55
this really fast. And we're going to say billing. So, this creates awesome. So, what did
4:39:03
we need in billing? Well, we wanted to have over here name. I go over here and
4:39:09
say name. Next, we said we want to have cost. So,
4:39:15
we're going to say cost. That is an integer. So, a number. And then lastly, we're
4:39:21
going to say favorite color. So, favorite color. It's going to be a string. Great.
4:39:26
Let's just put some BS data in over here. So, we're going to add in a new
4:39:32
row. And we'll add in another row. And we'll add in a third row. All right. So now what we want to do is just throw in
4:39:39
some names. I'm going to grab uh itch over here. Baseball player Ichiro.
4:39:46
We're going to say max for Max Sherzer. And then we'll have it in over here again
4:39:54
like that. Cool. The cost over here let's say is 100
4:40:00
50 100.
4:40:05
Let's say it's favorite color is blue. Blue. Max's favorite color is black.
4:40:12
Done. Simple. Done in two seconds. So, we're just going to go over here and export
4:40:18
this as a CSV. So, download CSV like that. And now we see we have billink.csv. Great. So, what we're going
4:40:25
to do is go into our form. We're going to say billing uploader.
4:40:30
And we're going to add in a form element. And over here we're going to say billing spreadsheet.
4:40:38
And uh we're going to say upload.
4:40:43
The billing spreadsheet. We're going to say element type file.
4:40:49
We're only accept one file. We can go over here and say it's a CSV only. And execute step. And you'll see it says
4:40:56
choose a file. I'm going just go on my computer really quick. Find this billing CSV. Great, we have it. Going to click
4:41:03
submit. And we have our billing spreadsheet. Great. Next. Oh, one other thing I need to tell you guys. You can't
4:41:10
pin binary data. So, you can see pin data is disabled as this node output contains binary data. Didn't cover that
4:41:15
in this video. I apologize. I was on my notes and I skipped over. Okay. So, now we need to extract from the binary data.
4:41:22
So, you notice how I called this billing spreadsheet and it says input binary field. Again, make sure this over here,
4:41:29
the field name is the same as this input binary field name. So, we're going to execute this step. And if we go to table
4:41:35
view, we have ID, name, cost, favorite color, created, updated. So, we're looking pretty good over there. Next
4:41:41
step, we wanted to remove all these extra things that we don't care about. Only thing we care about is name and
4:41:46
cost. That's it. So, execute step. Boom. We cleaned that up. Okay. Now, we want
4:41:52
to remove duplicates because we have duplicates in our data set. You can see of it 100, max 50, itro 100. We're going
4:42:00
to compare all fields. And then you can see it is now down into two. We have it and max cost 150. Great. Okay. Now,
4:42:09
let's add in additional data. Let's say we have another data point we want to
4:42:14
add into the spreadsheet. So, what we're going to do is create two new fields. To
4:42:20
keep these accurate, we have name and cost. So, we're going to go over here and call these name and cost. So name
4:42:26
of cost and then let's put in those values. So namewise, let's say we have
4:42:31
like Justin for Justin Verlander and we'll put a cost of 75. Let's execute the step just to make sure it works. And
4:42:38
it works. However, you notice I put string here. I should put a number and boom, we have that working correctly.
4:42:43
You can see that we don't want to have mismatch over here. Next, we want to put both of these into the merge like that
4:42:50
over here. Um, we're also going to have to do a um test over here because this
4:42:56
might not necessarily work, but we'll see. Remember, we had that issue a little bit earlier when we're talking
4:43:02
about merges. And uh we have a problem over here.
4:43:08
See what our issue was. Oh, you know what? It's empty. We should probably append that data. We're going to just
4:43:14
execute workflow. And we're gonna load this up over here. Submit.
4:43:20
And you can take a look over here in that table. We actually didn't call
4:43:26
that. So what I'm going to do is say that also starts this over here. Again, just kind of a weird bug with merges,
4:43:33
but that's okay. So we're going to just clean this up a little bit. So that way this trigger starts this edit fields and
4:43:40
also goes into the merge as well. All right, this should be fine here. We're going to execute this again. Upload that
4:43:47
billing. Click submit. And now you can see we have both items going into that
4:43:52
merge node. Item one there, two. And now we have three items. We have Justin, it ro and max. Awesome. So now all we need
4:44:00
to do is convert this into a file. So what we want to do is name the file. And
4:44:06
did I mention a name? I can't remember. No, I didn't. I'll say like new billing.
4:44:15
And let's go to add option. You can actually change the file name. So I'll say new
4:44:21
or let's call this like final billing CSV.
4:44:27
Actually, I don't think I even need the CSV section. I think I should just call it file billing. Let me just double check really quick.
4:44:34
No, I need to actually put CSV. So, make sure you put the exact name over here. When it says convert to CSV, make sure
4:44:40
you put that. Otherwise, it's not going to work. And now you can see it says final billing.csv.
4:44:45
And I can download our data that we have over here. And this would be also another case where you use edit set over
4:44:50
here just to make sure that um every every column that you want in the spreadsheet is there. And you could also
4:44:56
reorder things in edit set. So you can see like name is here first then cost. So if you want to reorder things you can
4:45:01
use edit set. Didn't really cover that also. Apologies but essentially download
4:45:07
it here. And you can see we have final billing.csv. So that is our workflow. Essentially
4:45:13
what we did is we submitted a file over here which was our CSV file. We forced
4:45:18
it to be a CSV on one path. We extracted from the file. We removed the extra
4:45:24
columns we didn't care about. We removed any duplicates on the other path over here. What we did specifically is added
4:45:31
another data point that was just missing from this form. Then we merged all of this together. All we need to do is
4:45:37
append because we're just stacking these particular inputs. and then we convert it to the file at the very end to have
4:45:43
our brand new spreadsheet. So, awesome job on this section. What we're going to
4:45:49
do next is actually take a look at how you can set up your Google credentials and uh this is going to be a big step
4:45:55
for you guys because Google is used all the time. You can think of this Gmail, sheets, drive and uh it's pretty
4:46:02
exciting stuff. So, I will see you guys in that video now and uh great work. So
4:46:08
this section is going to cover how you could set up the Google suite within any end. This is going to use something
4:46:14
called OOTH. And honestly, the first time you do it or take a look at it, you're going to think this is really,
4:46:20
really confusing. But you know, kind of the best part about it is once you set up the Google Suite once, you don't have
4:46:26
to do it again unless you're obviously working with customers in some sort of capacity. So once we set this up, you'll
4:46:33
have access to using the different Gmail nodes. you're going to have access to Sheets, Google Drive, Google Docs, and
4:46:39
some of the other Google services if you specifically want to do that. Um, I would recommend you just follow this
4:46:45
step by step. And also, the full documentation on how to set this up will also be available to download.
4:46:51
Obviously, pause the video as I go through this and follow it because it is super important not to miss a step.
4:46:56
Otherwise, you are going to have issues and something that would take you 10 minutes is now going to take you 20, 30
4:47:02
minutes or longer. After we go through those specific documentation to set
4:47:08
everything up, we're going to actually go through the specific triggers and nodes. I'm going to cover some of the
4:47:13
use cases that I see from building real world workflows and then we're going to go over to projects. So, uh it's going
4:47:20
to be another kind of a lengthy section over here, but it's really important because this unlocks a ton of
4:47:26
capabilities for you guys. So, first let's jump into uh setting up the OOTH
4:47:31
for all these. All righty. So, what we're going to do is set up Google Drive into any and uh so what I'm going to do
4:47:39
over here is just click over here to add first step. I'm just going to search for Google Drive over here. And you can see
4:47:45
that we have Google Drive and actions. I'm just going to go over here and click download a file. Right
4:47:52
now, there's a few different ways that we could specifically set up our Google Drive connection. We could go right
4:47:59
through here and build this out in our workflow. Or we can go into our account and do that as well. I'm just going to
4:48:05
go over here and go through this side of things and set it up like that just because I feel like this is where most
4:48:12
people are probably going to start at. And the first thing that you're going to want to do is go into your Google Cloud.
4:48:19
Just Google search Google Cloud Platform. And what you're going to do is grab this link right over here. It says Google Cloud Cloud Computing Services.
4:48:26
Make sure you go to your account and choose the specific account with your NAN account. Right? In this tutorial,
4:48:32
I'm using the Ryan Nolan data. And then what we're going to do on this side of things is click over here to console. So
4:48:39
this will load up. And what I'm going to do is create a brand new link from Google Cloud into N8N. So how I'm going
4:48:45
to do that is we go over here to open project picker. And then we're going to click on new project, right? And I'm
4:48:52
going to name this project N G Drive tutorial. Drive tutorial. Uh
4:49:00
it's going to say location, no organization. That's perfectly fine for this. So I'm going to click create. And
4:49:06
it says now viewing N Google Drive organization, no organization.
4:49:13
But we're going into this N G Drive tutorial. So make sure you click on that. And then we have this up over
4:49:20
here. So there's a few steps that we are going to have to take to set this up.
4:49:25
And depending when you watch this, the user interface may have changed. So click over here to these three lines.
4:49:32
And then we're going to go into API and services. Click on to the library over
4:49:37
here. And then what we're going to look for is drive. You should really put Google Drive.
4:49:44
Drive over here. And we're looking for the Google Drive API, right? So, we're
4:49:49
going to click on that over here. And the first thing we're going to do is click on enable.
4:49:55
This will take a second. Make sure that this runs and I will be back once this
4:50:00
is ready to go. Okay. So, we have this over here. The first thing that we're going to want to do on this side of things is go over to the OOTH consent
4:50:07
screen. So, click that on here and you're going to get this blank page. So, click get started. Uh, we're going to
4:50:13
put our app name. I'm just going to call this N Google Drive tutorial. Right. And
4:50:19
then what we're going to have to do as well is put in our email, which I have this already over here. Data. Next.
4:50:25
Since this is going to be an external application, click over here to external. Click next. Contact
4:50:31
information. Make sure to put in your email again. So, data@gmail.com.
4:50:39
Click next. And then I agree to Google API services. Awesome. continue and then
4:50:44
click create on this side of things. So once that is done, our next step is we're going to want to go over here to
4:50:50
the audience tab and we're going to want to click on publish app. Now if you don't click publish app, you're going to
4:50:56
have issues within nan when you do set up this connection. So make sure that you publish your app. Click confirm
4:51:03
and your app is done. Awesome. So now what we're going to do is go back into N8N. So it's going to say credentials to
4:51:11
connect with right over here. I'm just going to click create new credentials and then we get to this popup screen
4:51:16
over here. Right. So, a few things that we are going to want to set up specifically for that. What we're going
4:51:22
to do is go back to home where we get this on this side of things. Go to APIs and services and then click on
4:51:28
credentials. Uh so then we're going to get into this side of things. We're going to click on create credentials and
4:51:34
select OOTH client ID. So then we have the application type. Now click on to
4:51:40
web application. I'm just going to call this Google Drive NN put
4:51:50
that. And then what we're going to do is authorize redirect URI. So click add new
4:51:55
URI. Now go back in over here and you see it says OOTH redirect URL. Click to
4:52:01
copy that. Go down below over here and paste that in over here and then click
4:52:07
create. Okay. Now we have our client ID as well as our client secret. So really important that you copy these in. Also
4:52:13
save these just in case. So first we're going to do is grab our client ID. All
4:52:18
we go over here to client ID, paste that in. Then we go to our client secret. Copy that. We're going to paste in the
4:52:25
client secret over here. So both of those are there. Next we're going to have to do is sign in with Google. Now
4:52:31
if we didn't publish our app, we will have issues with the signin with Google, right? It's going to say N is
4:52:36
authorized. So again, make sure you your app. So we're going to click over here to sign in with Google. And you can also
4:52:43
see it says credentials successfully created. So what I'm going to do is grab the Ryan Nolan data account. And it says
4:52:48
Google hasn't verified this app. That is okay. So click over here to advanced and click go to N cloud unsafe.
4:52:57
And then make sure you select all on this side of things and click continue.
4:53:02
And it says connection successful. This window will close in 5 seconds. Right?
4:53:07
It closes down the window and then we have this in over here. The save password once, right? And we have that.
4:53:14
Okay. So now I want to show you essentially how we could grab essentially images within a folder in
4:53:21
Google Drive. This won't be a full tutorial on Google Drive within any but I feel like it is applicable just to
4:53:28
throw this in here at the very end. So what I have on this side of things and this is actually going to be a tutorial I'm recording right after here. So
4:53:35
essentially I have different images of cards and I want to grab them in nan
4:53:41
right. So I haven't fully decided what I'm going to do with these images as of yet. I'm kind of still in the tutorial planning stages but regardless it's
4:53:48
going to be part of it. So I felt like show this on this side of things. Uh so we're going to do is resource. We're
4:53:53
going to grab file and folder. We're going to search for JPEG images. So put
4:53:58
JPEG like this. Uh next we're going to do a filter. So click add filter. We're going to go over here to folder from
4:54:05
list. And what we're going to do is look for the card images on this side of things. And to make sure that this has
4:54:11
worked correctly, I'm just going to click execute step. And you can see on the JSON side of things, we have the ID
4:54:16
of each of these images. And then the name, right? So you can see we have Hannibal over here in the five grade.
4:54:22
This is where I was actually downloaded from. We have it right over here. Right.
4:54:28
Up next on there is what? Wolf.
4:54:34
We have Wolf. And then lastly, we're going to look for Cresbow and you can see he is on here as well.
4:54:41
So, just like that, I showed you how we could set up Google Drive within your N8.
4:54:48
Hey guys, post editing for this video, I realized initially this video I had on
4:54:54
my YouTube channel only showed you how to set up Google Drive and you're going to probably want to set up Slides,
4:54:59
Gmail, Sheets, all that good stuff. So I'm in my N Google Drive over here. I
4:55:05
just want to quickly show you really fast how you enable this. So when you go to enabled APIs and services, just
4:55:11
search for the next API. Uh so for example, if I want to get Google Sites, which I've never used actually in any
4:55:17
NN, click on this over here and then just click on enable
4:55:23
and then you'll see it's getting enabled to your account. Obviously, I called this one any Google Drive for that particular video when I was shown the
4:55:30
Google credentials. Might want to change the name, but regardless, now you can see that this has been enabled in my
4:55:35
account. Same thing with calendar. If I want to go over here to Google calendar, I'm just going to search for calendar
4:55:40
and then we're going to look for this Google calendar API. And then we're going to click enable over here as well. So, we have to enable
4:55:48
all these in our Google Cloud account, which this one's the and Google Drive just because it was the tutorial, not my
4:55:54
main one. And then when you're back in Nan, what you have to do is you're going to have to authenticate each of these as
4:56:00
well. So just follow the same process. Like I'm in version two over here. Obviously that video I recorded early on
4:56:06
on my YouTube channel when we're jumping into any end and I just reused it because it's like credentials. But
4:56:11
regardless, same exact thing that you're going to go through where we have credential to connect with. You're going to have to create a new credential
4:56:18
and then just go through the OOTH over here. So, you know, the client ID,
4:56:23
client secret, and you should be pretty good to go. You're gonna have to do that for each of these in particular uh that
4:56:30
you want to use with Google. So, literally the process is exactly the same that I showed you. All you need to
4:56:36
do essentially is enable each API one at a time directly here in Google Cloud and
4:56:42
then just go back over here and copy and paste the same exact information into the individual notes. Create an account.
4:56:48
Label it properly. Don't label like Google account one like I have in this test account. Um, and uh, be good with
4:56:55
it and you should be pretty much set for the rest of this particular tutorial. If you have any questions, I'm actually
4:57:01
going to put a full doc like step by step on how to set this up properly in our school group. So, that'll be there
4:57:08
on that side of things. You can just follow it. I'll put screenshots exactly and should be pretty good to pair with
4:57:14
that last video and then also this video over here. But I just realized that this would be a source of confusion if I only
4:57:20
showed you Google Drive. So, I wanted to throw this in here really fast. I just recorded my laptop. All right, hopefully
4:57:25
you guys are getting a bunch of value. And now, let's expand on Google Drive. So, let's cover the four different
4:57:32
Google core nodes that you'll probably use about 90% of the time. The first one
4:57:38
is going to be Gmail. And if you go over to the Gmail side of things, you'll notice that there is a trigger which is
4:57:45
on message received. and you have 26 different actions that you can do. So,
4:57:51
let's first talk about the trigger and why this is really important. So, I'll just click over here. Uh first,
4:57:57
obviously, you want to make sure that you set up your correct uh credential to connect with. And then you have a poll
4:58:03
time. And if you go over here, it says time at which polling recurs. So, this will tell you like how often should this
4:58:10
take a look at your Gmail account. And you can change this setting to every minute, every hour, day, week, month,
4:58:17
every x or custom. Custom goes back into cron jobs which we talked a lot about before. You can say every month choose a
4:58:24
specific hour. Every hour on what minutes, every day, what hour on that
4:58:30
day, as well as minute, every minute itself, every x, you can set a value and you can set the unit whether minutes or
4:58:36
hours. So, there's a lot of customization over here, which is why I don't really think most people are going
4:58:41
to have to use a specific cron message. Uh, we're going to go over here and say
4:58:46
sorry, cron job. So, you have that. You can also add in multiple polling times if necessary. Again, I just think most
4:58:52
people are going to use that. So, you can also choose the event. So, by default, it's going to obviously be
4:58:57
message received. And if you go to your filters, you can include spam and trash,
4:59:02
which personally I probably wouldn't recommend. Uh, you can also search. So,
4:59:08
if you want to only grab emails that have an attachment, you can see it says has attachment. It says use the same
4:59:14
format as in the Gmail search boxes. So, you can actually click onto this and it
4:59:19
tells you how to refine searches. So, you can say, okay, find emails sent from a specific person. You can go over here
4:59:27
and say, search for emails received during a certain time period. Like, there's a lot of different options for
4:59:32
you. Obviously, I don't think the time period is that great for this search, but uh if you want it from a specific
4:59:38
person, I think that's beneficial. If an email has an attachment, let's imagine that you're doing some sort of contract
4:59:44
work and you're getting contracts in and you need to extract the data from contracts. That's where has attachment
4:59:50
would be useful as well as possibly uh from you can do multiple criteria with
4:59:57
and over here. Again, I'm not going to cover every single thing over here because it's going to be different for
5:00:02
every person, but you can put in that search over there, and a lot of people do that as well. I can do the read
5:00:08
status, whether it's unread, emails. Again, if you're going to build this out as a trigger, I would assume most of
5:00:14
these are going to be unread anyways. And then you can specify the sender over here. So, you could specify that in the
5:00:20
search or you could put this on that sender side of things. You know, if you have an internal system and let's say
5:00:27
for example, I work at fintech. So maybe we have an email that just sends things that are possible fraud transactions to
5:00:34
another email. We could just search for that specific sender. You have also label names or ids over here. Uh so you
5:00:40
can see uh there's quite a bit over here that you could fill out. Um and one of
5:00:46
the things also that's interesting is simplify versus non-simplify. So, when you have simplify, you'll notice also
5:00:53
other options are gone. So, it's just a it gives you a little bit of information. If you want all the
5:00:59
information about your email, you're going to have to have to turn off simplify. I'll show you that here in a second. You can also download
5:01:05
attachments when simplify is particularly off. So, I'm going to send myself an email and just show you the
5:01:11
difference really quick. Cool. So, I just uploaded uh email or I should say uploaded, but I just sent myself an
5:01:18
email over here. And what I'm going to do is just do a fetch a test event just so that way I can pull this in. So this
5:01:24
is a simplified version of it. So you can see on this side of things from Ryan Nolan data to Ryan Nolan data. We can't
5:01:31
actually grab the attachment. It's labeled as important. And uh yeah, I mean it's good. We have
5:01:38
our subject line over here. The message on this email is actually blank. So maybe I should have put a message over
5:01:44
here. And if I unsimplify this, if I fetch the test event, you can see we
5:01:49
have a lot more information over here. We have the HTML as well the text uh
5:01:55
again more from information. And then we can go into add options and we can download attachments. So obviously you
5:02:01
want to make sure something is secured for those test or for the download attachments. And now you can see we have
5:02:06
a binary file in here. So, when we were talking about binary files a little bit earlier, obviously you didn't have
5:02:13
Google set up, but one of the most common use cases for binary files, we're going to get an attachment through a
5:02:20
specific email. I actually did this recently with a doctor and we're building out essentially an end workflow
5:02:26
where he gets a specific email from someone in his department and runs through a whole nan workflow and gives
5:02:32
them results. So, it starts the whole workflow with a Gmail trigger kind of just like this. We download it. We
5:02:38
extract it. Uh, next, which we've already covered the extract from file node, right? We go back over here to
5:02:44
extract from file. And uh, sorry, I didn't meant to go there. Extract from file. Extract from CSV. And uh, we could
5:02:52
just go grab attachment zero. Put that there. Remember, it's the field name. So, this is attachment zero. Execute
5:02:57
step. And look at that. Now, I have my runner notes over here. This table
5:03:03
grabbed directly from a Gmail. So hopefully a lot of this makes sense. In
5:03:09
addition, what we could do too a little bit later on and actually let me show you this now. We could summarize emails
5:03:15
with an AI agent. And I know we haven't really talked a ton about prompting as of yet. We got our feet wet a little bit
5:03:21
with an AI agent, but it's very common to have a Gmail or email go straight
5:03:27
into an AI agent and we do some sort of summary based off of this. It's also very common to either before or after
5:03:34
the summary have some sort of if condition or a switch to route things
5:03:39
around. So let's say we receive an email and if it's a criteria we go over here or we go over here. Typically this is
5:03:46
probably after like an AI agent or after it's cleaned up. But you can start seeing how we we start piling things on
5:03:52
together. And this is honestly just from the trigger itself. Maybe I should just keep these in over here. I'll keep this
5:03:59
here for you guys notes. And uh yeah, so let's also I'm just
5:04:04
going to send you another email really fast. I shouldn't say send you, send myself. Uh we're going to go over here,
5:04:10
tester for video 2, and I'm going to send a body this time with no
5:04:17
else. I'm just going to literally spam my keyboard and hopefully it doesn't hit in the spam filter. Right, let's uh test
5:04:24
fetch event. Great. And you can see what we have over here. Where is this test for video two?
5:04:33
Great. You can see the HTML of the email. All this getting spammed out,
5:04:38
which is fantastic. And uh this is the non-simplified version. I don't have any attachments
5:04:44
here. So I'll just remove that. But if we simplify this now, you can see we
5:04:49
have over here on that side of things. So I would probably recommend and you can see we have a snippet over here. So,
5:04:56
one other thing to mention is when you simplify it, you only get the snippet. Whereas, if you have it not simplified,
5:05:02
you can actually get the full email. Obviously, there's some cleanup that you're going to have to do. But I would just recommend don't simplify your
5:05:09
specific email. Let's talk about some of the Gmail nodes as well because I think some of these are going to be pretty
5:05:15
important. Obviously, I don't have the time to cover every single one of these, but there's a lot that you could do with
5:05:20
it. So, you could add labels to messages. You could delete a message. Where I find this helpful is like if you
5:05:26
have a ton of different spam or things in your inbox you don't care about. I will say get care be be very careful
5:05:31
though because I just probably wouldn't recommend to delete everything out of an
5:05:36
inbox. Maybe you want to send it to a specific area instead of deleting it. Uh you can also get a message or get many
5:05:43
messages. So if you want to get every single message within a conversation, you have that option over here. You can
5:05:49
mark things as read or unread. Remove labels. You could reply to a message
5:05:54
where this could be helpful for I don't really say you should focus on the draft, but imagine you want to
5:06:00
autorespond to specific people. You could have it over there. Again, I would probably recommend draft just because
5:06:06
you can add in something called human in the loop, which is essentially allowing someone to review whatever AI generates.
5:06:12
Coming from the corporate world, a lot of companies believe in human in the loop. They don't want automatic responses. However, if you know
5:06:18
something is like very very accurate and you're okay with the downside of it occasionally being inaccurate, maybe you
5:06:24
do reply to a message, you can send a message automatically. Again, very helpful at the very end of a workflow if
5:06:30
you have orchestration that you say once this is done, I want to send a message to person X and that could be a message
5:06:37
or that could also be a message with an attachment. Uh, find that. You could send a message and wait for a response.
5:06:43
There's more labels. I don't really use labels as much as a lot of other people do, but you have tons of actions.
5:06:48
Create, delete, get label info, or get many labels. Drafts I find helpful. So, you can create a draft over here, and I
5:06:55
would just recommend doing that. And we're just reviewing an email before it's finally sent. But it can save you a
5:07:00
lot of time. And then you have thread actions. So, you can add label to a thread, delete a thread, get a thread,
5:07:05
get many threads. So, I just want to show you really quick one of these options, which is going to be send a message. So, let's go over here and do
5:07:12
that. And what we're going to do is I'll just use my Gmail account. Message send.
5:07:18
We'll put an email. I'll say Ryan Nolan data data@gmail.com.
5:07:26
And we're going to say hello world.
5:07:31
And uh we're say this email will be read
5:07:37
live on a YouTube video. You can see for the options down below
5:07:43
over here you can append to any attribution or not. So essentially what this does and a lot of people will turn
5:07:49
this off if you have this on which is the default LCO sent by any N. A lot of people don't want to see that so they
5:07:54
just turn this off. Next thing you can do is set add attachments. So what you
5:08:00
would want to do is have a binary file. Remember that top section in red? Well that would be the name that you populate
5:08:05
over here. So uh thought we had this. Oh, I guess I I um had the second
5:08:12
example, but if you remember earlier where we downloaded that attachment and had the top name, essentially you just make sure that top name matches over
5:08:17
there. If you have an attachment, again, very common to specifically add. Um, let me remove these. And you can add
5:08:23
multiple attachments over here, too. You can BCC or CC. You could have a sender
5:08:28
name over there as well. Send replies to or reply to sender only. Obviously,
5:08:33
depends what happens. We're going to send this over here without with the anyn attribution so you can see what it
5:08:38
looks like. And obviously you can just remove that. So I'll execute the step. It says unread sent inbox. And let's see
5:08:45
if I got it over here. Great. I have it over here. And let me populate this
5:08:50
here. So it says this email will be read live on a YouTube video. And then we have this email sent automatically with
5:08:56
any end. So if you want to remove this email iss over here and remove that. I can send
5:09:02
this again. And I'll say hello world 2. Execute that step. It's been sent. I'm just going to load this up in my email.
5:09:08
And once that is ready to go, we'll see. Here we go. This email will be right live on YouTube video. And that is gone.
5:09:15
Obviously, again, we have tons of different options over here. Really start messing with emails because it
5:09:20
opens up a lot of opportunities there. Okay. So, next is sheets. Now before
5:09:26
data table sheets was used honestly in almost every workflow just because most
5:09:32
people have their Google credentials set up. It's super easy to integrate in with Google Sheets after it is obviously it's
5:09:38
a little bit pain the first time you do it. Now let's talk about probably the most used out of the Google suite which
5:09:44
is sheets. Now it's been down quite a bit since data tables have been added in. Also I want to say it's kind of
5:09:50
funny when you type in sheet data tables is first then Excel then Google sheets. I feel like Google Sheets is should slot
5:09:57
in number two, but obviously N obviously wants to promote their data tables as well. So that's why it's the very top.
5:10:02
But if you go into Google Sheets, you'll see that we have different triggers as well as specific actions. I do want to
5:10:08
call out our triggers first over here because I think some of these are pretty beneficial. So really there's three
5:10:16
triggers, but they're based off of two actions. So the first one is on a new row added. So imagine that you have a
5:10:21
spreadsheet and someone adds in a new row and you want to start a workflow based around that. And the second is on
5:10:27
a row updated. So this is used typically when you want to watch one specific column and see if there is a change
5:10:34
associated with it. And then lastly you have on row added or updated which is either one of these two. I'm going to go
5:10:41
and show you guys an example on a row updated at. So I'll go in here and right
5:10:47
now I just have a pull time of every minute. Obviously, you can change that as required. We can go to a document.
5:10:53
Choose the document you want. I'm going to just use all YouTube update. And what I'm going to go is find our sheet. And
5:10:58
we're using sheet three over here. So, what I have on this sheet three is name of two artists and then a status. So,
5:11:05
we're going to look for this status column to specifically change. And this is very, very common. Like people will
5:11:11
build out a spreadsheet, they wait for a column status to change like ready to generate or good to go or something like
5:11:17
that and then it builds out the workflow. So what we're going to do is
5:11:22
build that out essentially. So we have a Google sheet trigger. We're looking at sheet three. We're triggering on a row
5:11:27
updated. Again, you can look at row added or updated. I'm just going to do updated. And options you can say columns
5:11:33
to watch. So this will only trigger the workflow when the status column is changed. So we'll say fetch test event
5:11:40
and you can see we have Bruce Hornsby, Billy Joel. The status is yes and no. Obviously nothing has changed yet.
5:11:46
That's fine. Then what we typically want to do next is have some sort of filter
5:11:51
in place. So what we're going to do is have an an if. So
5:11:58
what I'll have over here is say if and we're going to say status is equal to
5:12:04
and then you can put something like ready to go. So ready to go. It's going
5:12:10
to go and start the workflow over here. Otherwise, you can have a false. And I
5:12:15
typically just say do nothing over here. No operation do nothing. We I know we haven't really covered this as of yet,
5:12:21
but it literally as it's mentioned nothing, do nothing. So like it's just kind of a blank node. But essentially
5:12:28
how this works, you'll see it goes and grabs the sheet and both of these are
5:12:33
going to go into a false because nothing ends up happening. But if let's say for example we changed the status over here
5:12:40
and we put the status to ready to go. Um if this was in production which we're
5:12:45
not in production right now it would run the workflow automatically based off the polling time and it would
5:12:52
go in over here and it would say hey this is ready to generate and then we would have our steps that we want to take over in this direction. So if I run
5:12:59
this now, take a look. We have one item that populates into the if and that's going
5:13:04
to be Bruce Hornby, which is ready to go. So a pretty nifty trick that people use to say, "Hey, this row has been
5:13:10
updated. It's time to grab something else." Again, just an example I used recently for a customer is we're
5:13:15
building out an email newsletter. There's like 10 columns worth information that they specifically
5:13:20
wanted and there was one column which was a status column which we filtered based around. So as soon as someone put
5:13:26
ready to generate, it started the specific workflow for that particular column. And then we had things that are
5:13:32
like yes, it's done or a failure and things like that. Like it's a way more complicated workflow than I would show
5:13:37
you guys over here, at least where we're at in the tutorial series, but or I
5:13:42
guess one video um but another day. So that is one of the biggest use cases uh
5:13:48
using a trigger. Someone makes an update to a column. If you were looking at for a specific row, imagine someone adds in
5:13:54
a row. Let's add in another piano focused performer. I think the first one
5:14:00
probably is Elton John because people compare him like Billy Joel. And then you can have whatever status, I don't
5:14:05
know. And essentially that would start a workflow if we're just adding in a new specific row. I kind of prefer the
5:14:12
status or whatever verbiage you want to use instead of status because I think it's a little bit cleaner and a little
5:14:17
bit more secure because I feel like people could just accidentally add in a new row. Um and also you know you could
5:14:23
have this filter in place over there. All right let's talk about some of the other things that you can grab in sheets. So if I go back to sheets
5:14:30
we talked about the triggers but uh there is other actions. So you can actually create a spreadsheet or delete
5:14:36
a spreadsheet. So imagine you have a lot of data you want to create a brand new spreadsheet. Essentially what you can do
5:14:41
is go through over here. You can create a document over here title. You can add in specific sheets as well. Um this only
5:14:48
creates the spreadsheet. You have to add in the data a little bit later on, but you have that option over there as well
5:14:54
if you want to particularly delete one. Going back into sheets, go there. You
5:15:00
can see we can append or update a row. Typically, if you do some sort of research or you have some sort of um
5:15:07
monitoring or logging, you can update and things like, hey, this failed. And you can go back over here and say this
5:15:13
failed if it didn't populate correctly. You can clear a sheet as well which just
5:15:18
removes all the data. Uh you see already create a sheet on that side of things. So a sheet is the individual tab. A
5:15:25
spreadsheet is everything all together which is why when we go into create spreadsheet you'll see the option over
5:15:31
here for sheets and you can add in multiple sheets as necessary. Like in this example we have three sheets. So
5:15:37
you could specifically create a spreadsheet with three speech and uh maybe I'll do that for you guys here in
5:15:43
a second. Uh going in back into our Google Sheets uh we can also let's see
5:15:49
we did append clear. We can delete a sheet delete rows or columns get rows in
5:15:54
sheet as well as update rows. So let's first grab get rows and sheets. So just
5:16:00
to show you I'm go my sheets account sheet within document. We're going to go and grab this YouTube one. So all
5:16:06
YouTube we're going to go to sheet three. You can see that this grabs everything over here. So row number name
5:16:12
and then also status. You could add in filters over here as you specifically want to. As you can see filters populate
5:16:21
those. So we can add in filter. Let's say status over here is yes.
5:16:30
You can see it's filtered down very similar to what we've had in data tables. So that is the get rows in
5:16:35
sheets. And let me just add in a row as well. So you can just go in here by the way and and change this up. So instead
5:16:41
of get rows, we can go and append row and uh you can add in something else. So
5:16:48
you can see we have to map each of these over here. I'm trying to think of another piano player which we can add.
5:16:53
There's a lot. I'll just put in Mosart. Mosart say no too much. And uh see execute
5:17:03
step. That's been added. And I go to our sheet and you can see Mosart is added over there. However, let's say, you know
5:17:09
what, I actually want to delete Mosart. He does not belong in here. So, instead
5:17:15
of append, what we can do is delete. So, delete rows or columns, which as you saw
5:17:20
in data tables, we don't have the option for deleting columns yet, only rows. And we're going to go to all YouTube update
5:17:26
sheet 3. Delete. Obviously, we want to choose rows. And then you can start with a row number over here. There's other
5:17:32
options too, but we're going to start in uh
5:17:37
but we're going to start over here. We're going to just start with five. So,
5:17:42
let's go start in row five. Execute. And it says true. And take a look. That is
5:17:49
now gone. Again, there's a lot of options and you'll get used to sheets the more that you use it. But yeah, so
5:17:55
just going in here one last time. You can create or delete an entire spreadsheet. You could create or delete
5:18:01
a specific sheet in itself or clear the sheet. You can add in new rows over here. You could delete rows or columns.
5:18:08
So there's not an option right now to add in a new column. You can see it's only with rows, append row, append or
5:18:14
update there. You can get all the rows in a sheet. You could update that. And then again, you could start a workflow
5:18:19
when someone adds in a new row or you could start a workflow when someone updates a specific column value. Um, so
5:18:26
we're going to just throw all these over here. And you guys can download all these templates. What we're going to do next
5:18:33
is take a look at I believe Google Drive. Yeah. So, we can look at Docs and Drive. Let's go to Docs first because
5:18:40
it's kind of quick. So, we go to Docs.
5:18:45
You'll see Google Docs right there. And you have different actions. You can create a document, get a document, or
5:18:51
update a document. And uh yeah, so let's say you have some text you want to turn
5:18:57
into a document. You can go in here and create a document. You specify where it's at. You create the title name
5:19:03
associated with it. Then what you can do next is actually update the document. So
5:19:08
if we go into Google Docs again, we'll just go over here and say update a
5:19:13
document. So why I find this really helpful
5:19:18
is you can actually specify where in a document you want to upload uh some
5:19:23
additional information. What I've done in the past is create some sort of template. So essentially I'll put like
5:19:30
brackets and say like fill this information in and we can have an any workflow that automatically updates a
5:19:36
document uh based off of a template. So you can see we have an insert location at the end of a specific position. We
5:19:43
can insert an index as well. But we can also just literally update sections
5:19:48
within a document based off what is going on in any in workflow. Uh, we'll I'll show you one of those examples.
5:19:55
Well, actually, I'll I have it on the channel, so I'd recommend you watch that video, but it's like 20 30 minutes. We
5:20:00
don't have the time to cover that, but yeah, you can create a document. You could also update a document with a
5:20:06
specific text. And then lastly, if you go to Google Docs, I believe the third one is you can just delete a document.
5:20:12
It's pretty straightforward. Uh, no, you can uh create, you could get or update.
5:20:17
So, I apologize. You can't actually delete a document over here, but you can get that document. Okay, that is Google
5:20:24
Docs. Now, uh what's the use a little bit more is Drive and let's jump into
5:20:31
Google Drive. There's a lot of different options over here. So, let's jump through those. The first one is the
5:20:36
triggers. So, you can take a look at changes to a specific file or a folder
5:20:41
in Drive. I've started workflows before where let's say for example someone drops a new image into a Google Drive
5:20:48
folder and then it starts a workflow based around that. So you can see changes on a specific folder or the
5:20:53
specific file to jump into some of the things that are used quite a bit. Sometimes I've had to copy a specific
5:20:59
file to create another version of it. Uh you can create a file from text. You could also delete a file or download a
5:21:07
specific file. So downloading a file will get that binary data directly in NEN. You can move files between things
5:21:14
which I don't use that that often. Share, don't use that often. You can update or upload a file. Uh you can
5:21:20
search files and folders that can be helpful. Uh you can create a folder, delete a folder or share folder. Again,
5:21:27
these can be a little bit helpful for the create the folder or possibly delete the folder. Let's say you have a
5:21:33
workflow that you want to create a folder full of images every single time. Uh that's where a create a folder would
5:21:38
be. And I could see this being used with the new image or video models. You have a workflow that you're creating images
5:21:44
for a specific Facebook ad and then you want to just create the folder based around it. Uh you can create a shared
5:21:49
drive, delete share drive, get over here and update a shared drive. So uh download file is really kind of be the
5:21:56
most important one. Let me just pause the video really fast and we'll grab a file to download. All right, so I'm
5:22:02
back. Uh so what I essentially did is I have my Google Drive account. I did a resource. I just looked for a file over
5:22:08
here. Operation download and then I grabbed a file from list. I literally just looked for the first thing that
5:22:13
populated which I don't use this drive as much. So it's law of large numbers and this I believe was a PowerPoint
5:22:19
presentation that I put for that specific YouTube video. Obviously can't view the PowerPoint here indirectly in
5:22:25
any end. But you can see we have the binary file that has populated. So you'll use this quite a bit whether you're downloading a file or uploading a
5:22:31
file into drive. Uh, so just to show you the opposite, we go to drive and then you can see upload a file right here. So
5:22:39
again, you would want to fill this out. Choose a specific file name over there. Make sure the input data field name
5:22:45
matches to what is over here. So one to one over there, a file upload, and then
5:22:51
choose the specific folders that you particularly want. So your parent drive and the parent folder. There's other
5:22:56
options over here as well if you want to specifically fill these out. I don't use those all the time. And yeah, that is
5:23:03
essentially it. So that is the basics of the Google Suite. We're actually going to build out two workflows uh together,
5:23:11
but just to kind of reiterate what we covered. First, Gmail. Really powerful because it
5:23:18
allows you to send email messages, allows you to receive email messages and you can start a workflow based off of an
5:23:23
email being sent to you if that has an attachment or not. Next is Google Sheets. So uh very similar to data
5:23:30
tables that we have here in any and there's more that you could do in Google Sheets and I'm not even going to say sheets is the final solution because a
5:23:35
lot of people migrate from sheets into air table as well. Uh but obviously we're talking about the Google suite
5:23:40
right now. There's sheets very popular to start a workflow based off of a column change and you do see it
5:23:46
sometimes also with a specific row change. A lot of updates that you can do to a spreadsheet. You have Google Docs
5:23:51
over here where you could either create a new document, get a document or update a document. I've updated documents
5:23:57
before just based off of templates. And then lastly, Google Drive. Um, very popular to look when a new file is
5:24:04
uploaded. Uh, you can start a workflow based around that. This is downloading a file which allows you to get binary data
5:24:09
into your NAN workflows. And also very popular at the very end of a workflow, you do some type of building out of a
5:24:17
file, not out some complicated JSON, you convert that into a spreadsheet, and then you upload that into drive or you
5:24:23
create some type of image. Let's say you have an image workflow. Uh you're building out images or videos and you upload that into the drive at the very
5:24:31
end. Uh but this is really good for storage because you can't technically store the data here in any you'll have
5:24:36
to upload it somewhere. You know, there's other services besides Google Drive, but everyone has drive if they have a Gmail account or a Google account
5:24:43
and it just very simple to do. Man, I feel like this has been a very long section, but now we're going to talk
5:24:50
about two different workflows. I'm just going to take a quick break and then we'll jump those. Great. Let's cover our
5:24:56
projects for this section. So, the first one that we should do and I think there's going to be a better way to
5:25:02
approach this a little bit later on in the course, but we're going to do a weekly report generator. So, let's
5:25:08
schedule this at like a Monday at 9:00 a.m. Google Sheets is going to pull the data and then what we're going to do is
5:25:15
use a summarize node and then also kind of an email summary
5:25:20
at the very end. So, I'll leave this up into interpretation for you to do, but
5:25:28
let's try uh to build something out like this. Uh, pause the video. Three, two,
5:25:34
one, give it a shot and then I will be back. All right. So, let's build this
5:25:39
out. So, as it mentioned, we need to schedule this a Monday 9:00 a.m. So, we're going to go into triggers and uh
5:25:46
we'll go over here and say on a schedule. First thing we're going to do is every week and then we're going to
5:25:52
choose Monday and then we're going to choose 9:00 a.m. So, you can say 9:00
5:25:58
a.m. on the dot. So, that's perfectly fine. Uh the next thing what we need to do is grab data from Google Sheets. So,
5:26:07
we'll go into sheets like that. And then we're going to get
5:26:13
over here, get rows in sheets. Now, this is going to be the tricky part because we're going to have to do some sort of
5:26:18
filtering associated with it. I'm not going to worry about that um as of yet.
5:26:24
We can either filter directly into the sheet or we could filter somewhere else. Also, I'm just going to create a new
5:26:29
sheet for over here. And uh let's build out some basic stuff.
5:26:36
So let's imagine we have a date over here and then we have invoice amounts.
5:26:43
We're just going to spam these out. I don't know. It doesn't really matter
5:26:50
to me. And let's set some dates. So we'll say this is like 1210
5:26:57
25. We'll say this is 12 12 25. Let's
5:27:02
put some stuff newer as well. So, we'll say 12 20 25 12 22 25
5:27:13
then 12 7. So, this is going to be over here.
5:27:20
And uh let's test this out. So, we'll go over here and grab this all YouTube
5:27:28
update. We'll go into sheet four. Let's just execute this step. Great. We have
5:27:33
our row number. We have our date as well as our invoice amount. So, we're looking
5:27:38
pretty good over there on that side of things. Obviously, we're going to have to do some sort of filter. Personally,
5:27:44
with dates, I find it probably easier to filter outside of that. Uh, we could also set timestamps and things like
5:27:50
that. So, we'll just make a note and we're going to say filter over here
5:27:58
to be oops to be completed.
5:28:03
Then what I want to do is up next use a
5:28:08
summarize node. So, we're going to say summarize and let's get some data points that we want necessarily in here. Um,
5:28:15
obviously we're going to have to filter, but we can just test this for now. And what we're going to do on this side of
5:28:22
things, I'm just going to go to the JSON. Let's count the row numbers, add
5:28:27
in a field. Let's go over here and find the average invoice amount. Let's go
5:28:33
over here and find the sum of invoices as well.
5:28:39
And let's grab the max. So, we'll go over here.
5:28:45
And I guess also instead of row number, we should probably do invoice amount instead.
5:28:51
Great. And obviously you can choose these values if you want. And you can see we have this over there. Next, what
5:28:59
I want to do is have an AI agent. And we're going to say is write a very basic
5:29:06
prompt. So let's go over here. Define below. Say you are an agent. And by the
5:29:13
way, this isn't the approach I would take normally. We're going to show you that a little bit later on the course, but we're going to say you're an agent
5:29:19
that writes, a concise email
5:29:25
that summarizes paid invoices for last week. Here
5:29:33
are the data points. Let's expand that out. Say counts.
5:29:43
average sum max
5:29:50
and just throw these in. Let's put this as an expression.
5:29:57
And then let's expand it out just to make this a little bit easier. Counts, average, sum,
5:30:04
and max. Cool. And you can see all this is populated over here. Let's add in a
5:30:10
model. So, let's add that in Gemini since we've used Enthropic a bit. And that's fine. We're just going to use
5:30:16
Gemini 2. Actually, let's make this three. We go. Where is Gemini
5:30:25
3 Pro preview? That's image. Cool. So, we have that in over here. And
5:30:32
now, like obviously, we have all our data points that we need. We can also build out an email.
5:30:38
So, go to Gmail. We're going to say send a message.
5:30:43
Obviously, we can send drafts if we want. I'm just going to send a message to myself to Ryan Nolan data
5:30:53
gmail.com this week's report
5:30:59
email type and then message. Obviously, we're going to have to send it from the AI agent. All right. So, all this is
5:31:05
kind of looking like it's going to work. The only thing that we need to do now is filter this out. So, what we can do is
5:31:12
set that filter and let me think about how we're going to approach that. I'm just going to save this really fast.
5:31:18
We're going to go into a filter and we could use AI to help us out with
5:31:25
these dates if we want. We also have the date and time. So, there's a few different approaches that we could take.
5:31:32
Then, uh we might actually use AI. So, we're going to go over here. Date and
5:31:37
time is after we're going to say like last 7
5:31:44
days. So, I'm going to ask really quick into
5:31:51
a large language model how we can do that. So, watch what we're going to do. I'm going to copy this and I'm going to
5:31:56
load up Claude and we're going to go over here. I'm
5:32:03
going to say write an expression in nan to filter
5:32:10
the dates by
5:32:16
anything last seven days.
5:32:23
All right. So I'm sending this over here. I sent in a screenshot. I sent some context associated with it. Let's
5:32:29
see.
5:32:37
This is pretty readable. So, let's test this out.
5:32:46
And actually, we
5:32:51
might want to use an if instead. We're back to if.
5:32:57
Yeah, if is going to be better in this case than filter. All right. So, what we're going to do is
5:33:04
grab this date, say date and time.
5:33:13
Oh, actually, it's not going to matter. Throw that in there.
5:33:23
You can see we can set an expression. All right. So, we're looking for last
5:33:29
seven days. Let's see if this worked correctly.
5:33:35
Obviously, this didn't work as I kind of expected. I'm going to send all of this as a
5:33:41
screenshot there. So, check this out.
5:33:47
That obviously didn't work. Send it back in over here. That'll tell me exactly what happened.
5:33:56
I should have put also I'm using a filter node, not if.
5:34:05
All right, there we go. So, it gives me this over here.
5:34:16
Take a look today minus 7 days. Yeah, but exactly.
5:34:21
So that's why I mentioned like sure you can be a little bit faster if you memorize all of this, but really like
5:34:28
LMS are pretty good at this as well, just creating these expressions. So I just recommend that. And you see it it already took two things. I could have
5:34:34
prompted this way better over here, but at the end of the day, it worked. We kept two items. We disregarded these
5:34:41
specifically three. Um, obviously I kind of wish this 1220 was a little bit earlier, but that's fine. Or not
5:34:48
earlier, later. But that's fine. All right. So now what I want to do is minus this send a message. I want to test this
5:34:54
whole workflow. So we're just going to execute this workflow. I don't need this if anymore.
5:35:00
And you can see we have a problem with our AI agent. The reason why is actually have another workflow going on in the
5:35:05
background. So I'm going to just use OpenAI really fast. We're going to go to over
5:35:11
here and use GPT5 Mini.
5:35:18
Right now I'm actually uh building out a bunch of timestamps for our YouTube videos because they were missing and I actually have uh like 400 YouTube
5:35:25
videos, 300 something like that. So it is not working because of that.
5:35:34
All right. So now what you can see is have this going on
5:35:40
subject paid invoices summary last week
5:35:46
and uh cool
5:35:55
all of there and I'm going to say do not include a sum a subject as well. say, "Do not include
5:36:04
the subject, only the email body." Again, later we'll
5:36:10
we'll cover what makes a good prompt. And obviously, we could define it a
5:36:16
little bit better, but uh it's okay. All right, great. We have this now and
5:36:25
we can pass that in over here. So let's send this output over here as the
5:36:31
message. You can see what it looks like. Hi, last week we paid two invoices totaling
5:36:36
average amount was 46 and the largest payment was 93. Is that correct? So let's go back over here.
5:36:44
Yep, that looks correct. And we'll send that message. So send that. Put my
5:36:51
correct Gmail account. Great. It's been sent. And then let me
5:36:56
check my inbox to see if we actually got it or not. All right. And we jump over here. Look,
5:37:03
this week's report, hi. Last week we paid two invoices totaling 93. Average payment was blah blah blah. Right. And
5:37:10
that has been sent. Thanks. Obviously, I I should fix the formatting because you can see over here
5:37:17
by going back the new lines and things like that weren't actually sent. So, you can see we should probably send this as
5:37:23
like an HTML body. So that way we could format it a little bit better. Um, but this is just a very basic concept for
5:37:31
you guys or very basic idea. Um, yeah, we could also change that out. So, email
5:37:37
type instead of body. Let's put this as text so that way we could get that to work
5:37:42
and I'll execute this as a step again. All right, it sends Let me see if we have that over here. Probably should
5:37:48
have changed it a little bit different. Great. It actually did. So, last time I
5:37:54
sent that as HTML. This time I didn't. And you can see we have that correct. HTML template, by the way, for email.
5:38:00
Super super helpful if you're building out some designs and things like that. And obviously, I kept this attribution. I could change that if I want, but it's
5:38:06
kind of just to show you guys here in that specific video. So, great. We know that is working for this use case.
5:38:13
Hopefully, you're able to solve this out. Um, I just find pretty easy. Add in a filter first. schedule the trigger at
5:38:20
9:00 a.m. get the sheets, filter this out, summarize based off these data points, throw that into an AI agent, and
5:38:27
then send a specific email associated with it. Uh, the next one, which we're going to do also, is an expense tracker.
5:38:35
So, what we can do on this, and obviously, um, it's going to be a little bit different,
5:38:43
but let me show you.
5:38:48
All right. So, how we're going to work this is we're going to have a Gmail which receives email and it said
5:38:55
receipt. I'm just going to say receive because I didn't show you OCR yet. Initially when I was building out this course, I was thinking about putting OCR
5:39:02
a little bit earlier, but I decided to put an advanced AI section. So, uh, Gmail receives emails. We're going to
5:39:08
extract the amounts out. We're going to use an AI agent right now, but later on in the course, I'm going to show you
5:39:13
actually a better approach than using an AI agent. We're going to log this to a Google sheet and then uh we don't need
5:39:19
that monthly summary. We're just going to do it like that and let's jump into that. So, if you want to give this a try
5:39:27
uh test it out, pause the video. Three, two, one. Otherwise, I'm going to solve it. All right, let's go and solve this.
5:39:35
So, what we're going to do is use Gmail. Go to Gmail over here. We're going to get a trigger
5:39:42
say on message received. Now, you could remove this simplify if you want. I
5:39:49
would recommend you remove it. We're going to make sure we have a specific sender since we're an email, a party
5:39:55
email. I'm just going to put my email over here. So,
5:40:00
data.com. So, I only want to receive it over here. Obviously, up to you if you want to add
5:40:07
in that filter or not. We're going to extract out the amounts. So, we're going to have to use an AI agent on there. So
5:40:14
imagine we have it just an email in general and we're going to want to extract that out. So we're going to put
5:40:19
that over here. I'm going to grab our define below. Say I'm just going to say
5:40:25
you are an AI agent that extracts
5:40:33
dollar amounts from an email.
5:40:39
only extract all the dollar amount
5:40:51
email. I'm going to say only finals output
5:40:59
to be an integer.
5:41:05
And actually maybe we want to make this a float a float value and nothing else. Great. So we
5:41:14
have our AI agents over there and then we're going to go to sheets.
5:41:19
So go to sheets and then what we're going to do is let's say append a row in
5:41:24
sheets. Put my sheets account over here. Obviously we don't have this sheet built out yet. So let's go and build out a new
5:41:31
sheet. So, we're going to say these are like expenses. So, we can say expenses
5:41:39
and we'll say like 50, 100, 125 or 11245. It's fine. We're going to add in
5:41:45
a new expense over here. Again, I'm not being super scientific about it. We're
5:41:51
just making something simple just to make sure you get the concepts down. We have OpenAI over there. Awesome. Let's
5:41:59
go in here. grab the documents that we want. Go to sheet five. We have that
5:42:06
over here. We're going to say expenses, which is going to be after our AI agent. Obviously, I don't want to pin that yet.
5:42:11
So, we're going to save that. I'm going to send an email to myself. And let me do that really fast. I'll
5:42:18
show you the email, too. So, I'm going send that over here.
5:42:24
Expense 1228.
5:42:29
I spent $25
5:42:36
on a Chipotle bowl and large chip.
5:42:46
All right, I'm going send that out over here. And I have that in. So, let's fetch this
5:42:54
test event. Great. So you can see over here I spent
5:43:00
$25 on a Chipotle bowl uh enlarged chip in queso. We have our text as well and
5:43:07
we're good. So now what I'm going to do is send that into our AI agent.
5:43:12
We're going to say make this an expression and expand this out.
5:43:18
We're going to say email. We're going to pass in this text.
5:43:25
Great. So obviously we want to test our agent to make sure it's working properly. Hopefully we just get 25.
5:43:31
Boom. We get 25.0. As I mentioned, it's a float. A float is just an integer with decimals at the very end. Uh since we're
5:43:38
doing a currency, obviously we want to have that as well. We don't want to just round it to the biggest whole number.
5:43:44
All right. So now what we're going to do is just add this into our sheets. So we
5:43:49
have our output over here. We're going to send over this expenses on that side of it. So, we've added that in and uh
5:43:56
execute step 25. So, now going back over to our sheet, you can see 25 has been
5:44:03
particularly added. So, pretty cool workflow. We have a Gmail trigger that expects an email from a certain email.
5:44:09
We have an AI agent that takes that email, extracts out the dollar amount as required. Obviously, if there's multiple
5:44:15
dollar amounts, it's going to get confused. So, you should prompt it a little bit better. Like, hey, should we sum these up? Should we ignore it?
5:44:21
Should we take the max? you need to define your AI agent for all the scenarios that you can think of.
5:44:26
Obviously, like we're not covering that yet in this course. And then we just appended a row in sheet just like this.
5:44:32
So, I've seen literally jobs on like freelance platforms like Upwork that are this easy at times. Um, but it just adds
5:44:38
in like one or two additional steps and uh yeah, there a lot of different opportunities over there. So, that was
5:44:45
the Google section of the course. We essentially learned how to set up Gmail.
5:44:51
We learned how to set up Sheets, Docs, and also Drive. Then we went and built
5:44:57
out two workflows. Obviously, this was the more difficult of the two workflows because I asked for a few extra steps.
5:45:02
And you know, this combined both Gmail as well as Google Sheets. I feel like we didn't cover the other ones that well
5:45:08
through examples of Drive and things like that. But probably a little bit later on in the course when we learn about images and videos, uh, it's going
5:45:14
to be a little bit more applicable. Anyways, I think up next we're going to be jumping into HTTP requests. No, we
5:45:22
actually have documenting up workflow first and then we're going to be jumping into HTTP. So, uh, awesome job guys and
5:45:29
I'll see you in the next lectures. So, this section is going to be a bit of a breather in comparison to the previous
5:45:34
ones. In addition, I know upcoming we have our HTTP request and web hook which
5:45:41
tend to be pretty dense with information. So, you guys need a break. we're going to be talking about today
5:45:47
how to document your workflows. I feel like this is a pretty important concept. So, we should throw it pretty early on
5:45:53
within the course because what tends to happen with a lot of workflows, people will build them out and later on they
5:45:59
forget like why did I build out this logic? What is going on? Or if you deliver it to a customer, they don't
5:46:05
know nan and if they're trying to debug something, they just have no understanding what you particularly
5:46:11
built out. So, I'm going to be showing you guys essentially how you can use sticky notes, how you can tidy up your
5:46:17
workflows, uh some of the other things you can throw in with these nodes as well. In addition, I briefly want to
5:46:23
talk about one way to kind of present updates with your workflows to
5:46:29
customers. Now, we haven't even really talked about customers since it's going to be way later on in the course, but I just wanted to quickly talk about that
5:46:36
in here. So, one of the tools that I use all the time is something called Loom, and it saves me a ton of time. So
5:46:42
essentially what Loom is is you can record short videos uh just on your
5:46:47
desktop and then send it over to your customer and it essentially renders really really fast. And why that is
5:46:53
helpful? First, you can kind of walk through what you're building in a workflow, show some results and you
5:46:58
don't even have to jump onto meetings. See, one of the things that takes away a ton of time when you're building out
5:47:04
things for customers or you want to send something for clarity is jumping on calls because you'll say, "How are you
5:47:11
doing?" You'll chitchat a little bit and later you find out it's 30 minutes where you could record a two or three minute
5:47:16
Loom video and you are way farther ahead. So, make sure you guys are using Loom. I'm not affiliated with them in
5:47:23
any means, but honestly, it saves me a ton of time. also a little bit outside the scope of the section. What I like to
5:47:29
do when I give a final workflow is build out a Google document demonstrating like
5:47:34
why we have things in certain sections. We'll talk about this in like presenting
5:47:40
findings and things like that to customers at the very end of the video, but I just felt like we needed to quickly talk about Loom. All right, so
5:47:46
let's jump into our workflow. And uh obviously I have nothing over here yet,
5:47:52
but let's just build out something that could be useful. Let's say we have a
5:47:58
form trigger. And obviously I'm not going to build out an actual workflow. I just want to show you the documentation
5:48:03
side of things. So let's say we have a form trigger over here. Uh the next what we want to do is extract um from our
5:48:10
file and we're going to just pretend we have like a spreadsheet. Okay, so we're going to extract from a file. We'll say
5:48:16
extract from CSV. Next thing we want to do, let's say we have an AI agent of some capacity. The AI agent is going to
5:48:24
go and write something for each of these customers and do some research. Let's say we add in another tool over here.
5:48:31
Um, I know I haven't showed you guys tools yet, but that's fine. Let's say we have a perplexity tool over here that
5:48:38
does some deep research for a specific customer. And then what we have next is,
5:48:44
hey, we have all this information together. We need to write an email. So
5:48:50
we'll have another AI agent that literally just focuses on writing out an email. And lastly, let's send this over
5:48:56
to a customer. So we're going to send this through a Gmail node. And uh all we're going to do is click send a
5:49:02
message. Very basic workflow. I'd probably change a lot of things. Obviously, we would put different chat
5:49:07
models in over here. Let's just put these over here just to make this look a little bit cleaner. And uh yeah, so
5:49:15
let's start off and show you where these sticky notes are. So first thing what you would want to do is mention the
5:49:22
whole process like what is going on. We're going to go into our sticky notes and I like just putting you know how
5:49:28
does this workflow start? So this workflow starts and I'd make a note. Okay, this workflow starts
5:49:38
starts when someone enters in information
5:49:45
on form on website. They upload a CSV
5:49:52
CSV they want more information for
5:49:57
or okay and I just start going down the line extract from file is pretty basic so we
5:50:04
understand what is happening there for this AI agent what we're going to say is we research
5:50:10
the leads presented in the spreadsheet
5:50:18
perplexity helps us get this information.
5:50:23
This information again if I was actually making this finalized I would put a lot more detail in here. This is just a
5:50:30
quick video and then I'd say over here this AI agent this AI agent
5:50:37
AI agent goes and gets goes and I should
5:50:43
rewrite this. This AI agent creates an email
5:50:48
an email based on the examples
5:50:54
from XYZ. I don't know XY and Z. And
5:50:59
then we can lastly have that send message to the customer or whoever we
5:51:04
send that specific email to. So, this is like pretty poor on the documentation
5:51:10
side of things, but at least there is some sort of documentation. I I really recommend when you have things like AI
5:51:16
agents where it's not super clear what is going on, you write a sticky note because you have to go in over here.
5:51:22
You're going to have to take a look at the prompt that someone wrote as well as uh the system message. It's just extra
5:51:28
clicks and you don't necessarily need to do that. In addition, one of the things that's really helpful is we can actually
5:51:33
change what these nodes are called. And you know, it's not really helpful to have AI agent, AI agent one. And if you
5:51:39
build more advanced workflows, which you will, you have like AI agent 2, AI agent 3, all the way to like five or six
5:51:44
sometimes. So let's just re label these. And you can see if I go to the top left, I'll say email
5:51:51
creator AI agent. And obviously label these how you want.
5:51:57
And you could have your own formatting. And like this is a little bit too long. So maybe I just want to call this an email creator. I would say like lead
5:52:05
researcher. Man, I have caps lock on. I don't even
5:52:11
know. Maybe I don't. Hold on. Know what it is? It's my mic that's in the way and
5:52:18
I can't see my nice spelling as well. But let's
5:52:23
imagine I actually spelled this correctly. And you could re label these as well. and I'll just say like extract
5:52:31
from CSV. So that's pretty helpful. In addition, what you can do if you go to
5:52:37
the settings, you'll notice that we have notes and you can display notes and it says this grabs.
5:52:45
Obviously like that's not the case, but you can see we have a little bit extra text over here. Um, sorry, I should
5:52:52
probably put on this one. This researches a lead. this uses perplexity
5:52:58
and gets lead info. And you can see it's a little bit too
5:53:04
long on this heading. So just put a small few lines like maybe three words as a description. But you can throw that
5:53:09
there. Same thing happens over here outside the AI agent. You just have this extra line. Um so this is pretty
5:53:15
helpful. You can see we have this also over here. Upload CSV.
5:53:22
And uh you can see that's populated right there. So you can use a mixture of you know reabeling the node name. You
5:53:29
could use sticky notes as well as putting those additional notes here at the bottom. Just remember it's like
5:53:35
three and you have to click display note in that particular flow. So we're going
5:53:41
to save this. I just want to show you a few other things as well with these sticky notes that kind of may be helpful
5:53:47
for you. So I see some people they have different like label of colors. So you
5:53:52
can see if we click on this right over here we can change the colors associated with this. So some people might have
5:53:58
certain sections or readmes based around this. I would also recommend if you have like a really advanced workflow. All you
5:54:05
should all you could do and I should say all you should do is maybe have like a read me section here at the top like
5:54:10
what is happening in this particular workflow and and one of the things that might be a little bit helpful on that is
5:54:16
having a distinct color in addition having a different um size of text like all this text is the same in fact if you
5:54:22
go over here and put a header you can either put one two or three hashtag or pound signs and it changes the side so
5:54:29
you can see like for example readme like this and you'll see the size of it is large You could also change this up to
5:54:36
two. It's a little bit smaller. You could change this up to three and it's even smaller. So, um, typically I'll
5:54:42
probably put like a two. I think this is pretty good and it's super helpful. Now, there's a lot of other things that you
5:54:47
can put into a sticky note like this as well. You can actually embed in images and videos. In fact, I've embedded
5:54:53
YouTube videos in these. You can also link out to stuff. And I just want to quickly show you the documentation. So,
5:54:59
you can say you can style with markdown. So if you know markdown, you have that
5:55:04
option over there. I'm just going to add in another sticky note so you can actually see the guide. And this is what
5:55:09
I recommend basically. Again, I don't memorize everything. But you can see you can change the position, which I think I
5:55:16
already covered in the basic first video, but you can put the sticky note behind the particular nodes. This is
5:55:21
markdown. So you can see bold is two stars. So if I want to do bold, let's just go over here say bold test
5:55:31
test like this that is now bold. You have asterisk with
5:55:37
the italics. You have italic which is one star. This is a headings which I talked about. This is an example of
5:55:43
putting in a link. You can create lists. Oh, which I find really helpful as well, especially in a read me. Like you could
5:55:49
say like step one, step one, add CSV file
5:55:56
process research. And again, these are one word. I wouldn't recommend that. Um, I'd say
5:56:03
email and then send. Let me fix that for again. Be very
5:56:09
thorough with your documentation. But you can see I built out a list on that side of things. It says make images full width. Then you can also embed a YouTube
5:56:16
video. So pretty powerful stuff with these sticky notes and uh throw that together. All right. Promise you this is
5:56:23
the last thing in this section. But another thing I sometimes see is people have like jumbled up workflows. Like
5:56:28
don't make this your workflow. It literally takes two seconds to fix this. All you got to do is click this tidy up
5:56:34
and look at that. Way better. And just make sure these sticky notes are in places that you think would be
5:56:40
acceptable. If you're coming from programming background, just think of sticky notes as like comments. And um for those who don't have a programming
5:56:46
background, comments are just really important. So that way someone later on can understand what you are particularly
5:56:52
doing. And yeah, that is essentially the basics of a documenting workflow. Again, I would recommend that you probably also
5:56:58
have some sort of video demonstrating like what is going on in this workflow. You could use a loom. You could also have a word document just doing a very
5:57:05
quick writeup. Make sure you put in sticky notes. I recommend putting in a readme. Uh there's different formatting
5:57:11
that you can put in the sticky notes as well. Very basic workflow with these five. Make sure that these aren't all
5:57:16
over the place. You know, there's no um example project for this section since it's kind of pretty straightforward. Uh
5:57:23
but the next one when we're going to be talking about HTTP requests, you can bet there's quite a few examples. So that way uh you get that skill ingrained
5:57:29
because it is so important for orchestration. All right, we're going to jump into that section right now. So
5:57:35
these next two sections are going to be blended together. The first part I'm going to be teaching you about the HTTP
5:57:41
request node which allows us to use APIs within our NE workflows that are not
5:57:48
native to NEN. And the second section which is going to be kind of lecture 13 is going to be the examples of using
5:57:55
real world APIs. We'll use some that have technical pageionation. We'll use some that you have to have credentials
5:58:02
for. Others they're going to be pretty easy to set up. and we'll build a few different workflows from this. I assume
5:58:09
both these sections are going to be a bit longer, which is why I separated them out. The first part will be
5:58:14
teaching you the basics and then the second part will be implementing that out. So for this first part, I apologize
5:58:20
for the lack of ruled examples. The second part um which is going to be lecture 13 is going to really focus
5:58:27
around using the HTTP request. So with that out of the way, let's start
5:58:33
covering it because there's a lot to start learning and awesome. So what
5:58:38
we're going to first talk about is the node. So just go over here to the plus and then look for HTTP like this and
5:58:46
you'll see HTTP request. Now out on the service level there's a lot that is
5:58:51
going on. First we have a method. So we have delete, get, add, options, patch,
5:58:58
post or put. Then we have authentication which if you go over here you can see there's credentials and like predefined
5:59:05
it seems like there's so many credentials there but then you have generic and you have a lot as well. We
5:59:10
have header, custom off bear, basic o like there's a lot there. And then we
5:59:16
have query parameters, we have headers, we have body like and then you have even
5:59:22
other options over here. Batching, lowercase headers, redirects, responses,
5:59:27
pageionation, proxy, timeout. And you're like, man, I'm confused. What does all this mean? And in reality, you're not
5:59:34
going to need all this for every single API. And every API is going to be a little bit different. What I recommend
5:59:39
that you do though, however, is take a look at API documentation because that
5:59:44
should be kind of the first place where you look in every step because it'll tell you exactly how to set up this
5:59:52
node. In addition, biggest shortcut of all time is this importing curl. So why
6:00:00
this is beneficial probably about 90% of the time you import and curl it changes
6:00:05
all the settings over here hopefully with our second examples which we're going to go in lecture 13 there is an
6:00:12
example with a curl I assume there would be and we could automatically fill this out and you can see it's literally as
6:00:18
they call it game changer but let's start talking about the first section
6:00:24
which is going to be your methods now there's a lot over Here you don't really have to focus on all these. Let's talk
6:00:31
about the two that are the most popular. So the first is get. And essentially you
6:00:38
can think of get as you're going to be grabbing data from a website. So let's say a website has information on leads.
6:00:47
Let's say you are building out a lead list and you want to supplement that information. You want to see, hey, how
6:00:53
much does this lead make every year and what is their email address? Um, maybe
6:00:58
you have other personal information you're matching on, but you just want those two pieces of information. A website has these two pieces of
6:01:05
information. Well, if you do a get request into that website, you're going to be able to grab that data. Obviously,
6:01:12
there's more things involved with it, but for the method purposes, often that
6:01:18
will be a get request. The next one which you're going to use just as much
6:01:24
actually I'll say a little bit less is going to be post. Now post is going to
6:01:30
essentially create data on that website. So let's say for example you want to use
6:01:38
a pre-made scraper and a scraper will allow you to grab information on the
6:01:44
internet. Well you have to boot up that scraper. So to boot up that scraper or boot up a service that is on that
6:01:50
website, you're going to do a post request. So how these work together is
6:01:55
in the real world, sometimes you have to use a post request to activate some
6:02:01
service on a website and then use a get request to get the final results. So in
6:02:06
the past uh one of the services that I've used before is Appify. And this is a clear example of posting first and
6:02:14
then getting the information later. So essentially how this worked is I would have scrapers I would want to use for
6:02:20
Instagram. Let's say I want to grab Instagram followers for specific accounts. Well, you have to run the scraper first. So we post first to run
6:02:28
the scraper. When the scraper runs, it has all of its data ready to go. And with another API request, I actually get
6:02:36
that data and then I bring it back into nan. So we're going to have to actually set up two different NAN nodes. One for
6:02:43
post and one for get. I'll put all the notes here in a second so we can
6:02:48
reiterate it once again. But then the other things over here that you're going to use occasionally.
6:02:54
So put and patch depending on the documentation. There may be one of
6:02:59
these, there may be both of these. This is updating data on a website. Why I say
6:03:05
you won't be using this as much is because typically when you're building out any end workflows like you want to
6:03:11
grab data which is why you're going to have get most of the time and obviously post to create the data if it's
6:03:17
necessary. So patch is just updating data on a website and then you have delete which is deleting data on a
6:03:24
website. This really isn't that common just because like it's kind of weird to delete data on a site at times.
6:03:31
Obviously, there is use cases for it, but with your N workflows, you're mostly going to use get. You're also going to
6:03:37
use post in conjunction with get. I don't use header options. I've never
6:03:42
used those before. So, really focus on those four, but if I was going to narrow down your focus, really get familiar, no
6:03:50
pun intended, with get and post. So, that's the first side of it. Next is
6:03:55
going to be the specific URL. Now, with that URL, right, we're going to
6:04:00
specifically look for that in the documentation. So, every website that
6:04:06
has an API is going to give you some sort of documentation. So, here's an example of some documentation. This is a
6:04:13
website called httpbin.org. I literally just asked Claude, it's a a good example of a free website I can test, post, and
6:04:21
get methods at, and it gave me this one. So, we're going to try this out. And you
6:04:26
can see over here we have a curl request which actually we should use and then we have a link and it says hypin.org/post
6:04:35
and this is specifically for a post. So if we want to do a post we paste that in over here. Again all the URLs are going
6:04:42
to be different um based off of uh the website. So sometimes you might have the same URL, sometimes you might have it
6:04:48
different. It just you got to read the documentation. It'll tell you, hey, do you want to use a post method? Do you want to achieve this solution? use this
6:04:55
URL. You just have to be really good taking a look at the documentation. So, this documentation, all we're doing is
6:05:01
execute. And you can see we have this curl over here. So, we don't have any authentication on here, which makes it
6:05:07
really easy. And if I run the step, congrats, guys, because you have officially did your first post request.
6:05:14
Like, all we had to do is choose post, use http.org/post,
6:05:19
and you just set up your first API. Uh, next we're going to try get. So if we
6:05:25
want to try get, we go over here, take a look at get. We can try it out. We can do a test over here. And you can see we
6:05:32
have get like this. So grab that URL. Go back into n.
6:05:40
Change this out. Execute the step and take a look. We got a response. Now if you don't get a
6:05:47
response over here, you get some sort of error. Means something is wrong. Typically, if something is working correctly, you're going to get a 200
6:05:53
response. If there's an error, you'll get a 400 response or a 500. Typically,
6:05:59
400 is on your end, like something's messed up. 500, something is messed up on the API side of things. So, I really
6:06:07
want to show you, and I'm going to delete this because it doesn't really matter. Uh, curl because we have the
6:06:12
option over here, and you'll see import in curl. I'm literally just going to grab this curl just to show you that
6:06:18
this is super awesome because all we have to do is paste this in here. And again, this is a very basic API. Like
6:06:25
this is your example of walking and we're training right now for a marathon. So you're learning to walk with this API
6:06:32
over here. Um we click import and you can see we have more information. So I
6:06:39
grabbed get pasted in our get over here and we're also going to be sending in headers. So it says use field parameters
6:06:45
below accept and then it says value application JSON. So now if we go this over here boom it is working. We
6:06:52
imported in our curl. This I believe was optional which is why we didn't necessarily need it with that first
6:06:59
example but you can start seeing some of the sections over here and take a look at the documentation. So that is curl.
6:07:06
Obviously, we're going to go over some more examples a little bit later into the next side. And yeah, so let's
6:07:14
continue moving forward. Is there anything else I wanted to cover on the site? Well, we have patch. We might as
6:07:19
well look at patch as well. So, we can go over here and try it out. We'll execute that. And you can see we have
6:07:26
our patch. So, I just grab that. I'll go over here to our patch.
6:07:33
Paste that in over here. You can see we've updated data. And lastly, we can
6:07:39
go into delete. Try it out. Execute.
6:07:47
And obviously, this isn't doing anything. It's just for testing purposes, but you can just go over here
6:07:53
and click into delete. I just want you to get comfortable with how this node
6:07:58
works and setting it up. to add to this as well. With your AI
6:08:04
agents, you can actually use a tool. And uh I'll just show you with an AI
6:08:09
agent really quick. I believe this is a little bit later on in the course. I'm actually recording
6:08:15
this out of order, so don't kill me, but it will be in a correct order in the
6:08:21
final course. But we have our HTTP over here, and you can see HTTP request, and
6:08:26
it's the same thing, right? So you have your methods which we just covered, you know, delete, get, post, patch, input.
6:08:34
We have our URL. We have the authentication that we're going to be setting up. You can send query parameters, you can send headers, you
6:08:40
can send bodies. Then you have add options down below based around everything else. And uh one thing you'll
6:08:47
notice is there's a description on the tool. Again, I don't know if we covered this earlier or if we're going to cover this a little bit later, but when you're
6:08:54
attaching tools to an AI agent, it's super important that you write a clear description of what that tool is used
6:08:59
for and when you specifically use it. You put that in the description here and you put this in something that is called
6:09:05
a system message. So, put that and then you also call out like what happens if the tool fails. Now again I believe this
6:09:13
is a little bit later on in the course but since we're talking about the HTTP paper press node I might as well also
6:09:19
cover the specific tool that uh belongs with it. So that is like the very simple
6:09:26
basics of the HTTP request. Um let's talk also really quick about query parameters headers and body. So if you
6:09:32
cover over there whether request has query parameters or not whether it has headers or not and then whether the
6:09:38
request has body or not. depending on the documentation that you'll read through and again
6:09:44
you'll go to your API docs. It'll tell you, hey, send in a JSON body to our
6:09:51
API. This is what you need to send to start a post request. So for that
6:09:56
example, historically, I would have to copy an example of their JSON body, and
6:10:02
it would be something like this. I'm not going to write proper JSON here. I'll probably make a mistake. Someone might
6:10:07
be annoyed with it, but that's okay. And it might say like influencers, like you have to pass in influencers or
6:10:14
whatever the case may be. And then you'll have to put in like, okay, IG1,
6:10:21
IG2, etc. You get the point. We send this JSON over into the website and
6:10:28
based off of this website or based off this JSON, then the website can produce the post request. Uh sometimes you might
6:10:35
have a query parameter and you'll have something like a data set ID. So your
6:10:41
post request gets you a data set ID and then you just pass in your JSON. Let's say there's some JSON over here and you
6:10:48
pass it in as your query parameter and you get those specific results a little bit later. Headers you'll have like some
6:10:54
sort of authentication. So maybe there's like an API key and then you just post your X your API key like XP API key over
6:11:03
here. And one thing to mention is with these API keys, you do not want
6:11:09
to store them in your headers with these nodes. So the issue with storing them
6:11:15
over here or in a query parameter or whatever else the case is, anyone that accesses your JSON of your workflow can
6:11:23
access your API key. that is not secured. So, you do not want to do that.
6:11:28
Instead, you'll want to set up a credential. Uh so, when you go to authentication, you'll see a generic credential type. You want to set up one
6:11:35
of these OS. Again, it just depends on the documentation. So, like the most common ones you'll see, you'll see basic
6:11:42
O all the time, bear O, you'll see query off. So, and header off over here. So,
6:11:47
it just really depends on what the documentation tells you to do. If you see for example header off you you see I
6:11:54
have a lot of these over here you can see hey genen it's an a service to
6:11:59
create AI videos of like UGC creators or yourself that has a header off AI which
6:12:05
we're going to go over a little bit later in the series. It generates images and videos. That's a header off. A
6:12:10
mistral header off. Um web hook video. I just covered that. A YouTube video scraper. This was a header off. I go
6:12:17
back over here to a basic off. You can see I've done some basic O tests and
6:12:23
obviously this isn't everything over here. A baroth I haven't used. Query should have some stuff in here and query
6:12:29
off has our ampify as well as a Google SER for apply. So I guess appy was here
6:12:34
both for query off. So sometimes you'll use the query off and sometimes you'll use where was that at? Not basic
6:12:46
or header. Those are going to be the two most popular ones. And again, make sure to set up your specific generic uh off
6:12:55
type over here in your header off. All you typically have to do read the documentation. I'll say how do you want
6:13:01
to have this and then put in the specific value and it's going to be in the documentation. We'll cover that with
6:13:06
these examples. But it's just super important that you set this up one for one. Otherwise, you're going to have
6:13:12
some sort of error over here and you're going to be confused. So to kind of recap
6:13:18
what we covered so far, we have the HTTP request. It's either a node or it is a tool, a tool that's
6:13:25
attached to an AI agent, a node within an orchestration workflow. You have four
6:13:31
to five methods that you're going to typically use. 90% of the time you're going to use get and post. Sometimes you
6:13:38
have to use delete, which is going to just remove a resource. Sometimes you'll have to use patch and put to update
6:13:44
resources. It's very common to start with post and then use get. Um they kind
6:13:50
of link together. Next, you'll have the URL for that specific method or that
6:13:55
specific call. You're going to find that URL in your documentation. We're going to cover that in the next part. You have
6:14:01
authentication. So, a lot of APIs are going to be behind an authentication layer. You could be lazy and when you
6:14:08
import in a curl and keep the stuff over here. I do not recommend that approach. Instead, I would recommend that you set
6:14:14
it up once for it, whether it's like a header off or a basic O or a query off.
6:14:20
Fill out the information. Make sure that the name is one for one with documentation. You paste in your API key
6:14:27
over here because this is not shared this uh credentials. These are not
6:14:32
shared when you share your workflow. Um, also I should have mentioned predefined
6:14:37
credentials. There's a ton of predefined credentials as well. So you can see other APIs like there's tons and tons.
6:14:43
So before you spend a lot of time and try to read the documentation, see if your API is in over here uh because it
6:14:50
might not always be the case. You can send in query parameters, headers and bodies as well. Very common to send a
6:14:57
body, very common also to send in query parameters. And headers typically have like an API key of some capacity. Um,
6:15:05
great parameters. Typically I've seen with like data set ids and then body over here. I see this all the time with
6:15:11
a post. And one other thing I forgot to mention in this video and man I I meant
6:15:17
to bring it up in the beginning and I didn't. You know why do we want to use
6:15:22
HTTP requests for uh APIs and sometimes you know APIs that are even already
6:15:28
available in N. So like N has a ton of APIs already built in. So, for example,
6:15:34
if we go to HubSpot and you'll see we have 31 different actions that we can perform in HubSpot,
6:15:41
but HubSpot's API is pretty extensive and there's way more than 31 actions.
6:15:47
So, if your action that you want to perform within your CRM and HubSpot is not here, you're going to have to set up
6:15:53
an HTTP request. For example, um let's go into another one. Let's say I wanted
6:15:59
to use Kai, which is going to generate images and videos. Well, if I go over here, Kai is not in Nan. If I type in
6:16:07
Kai, you can see it's not there. So, to use that service, which I'll just show you the website, like this is a great
6:16:13
website. It's a super popular website. Can't access this without an HTTP
6:16:18
request node. So, just that important for you to build that out because you're not going to be able to go to this API
6:16:24
market and build AI images or videos or music. So, you have to set up this HTTP
6:16:30
request. So in some ways like it supplements so it's already here in nan
6:16:35
and it expands upon it. Now if the API request that you specifically want is
6:16:41
already in nan just use that approach like ampify has been added and in the
6:16:46
past to the run actor and get a data set. I used to have to set up two HTTP requests I used to have to go over here
6:16:53
set up a post request. So I'd have to go over here post and obviously fill out all these settings. I would have to set
6:17:00
a wait node because it wasn't ready right away. Let's say the wait is 60
6:17:05
seconds. And then I would have to go and get another HTTP request and essentially
6:17:12
get our data set. So I'd have this with Appify and now there's this one single
6:17:17
node that does it. So if your API is available in any end obviously just
6:17:22
search like search the service over here. it's available and it's natively in here or if it's even a community
6:17:28
node, do that first. Check that out. If it's not, then you're going to have to use this HTTP request to access other
6:17:35
items. And because of this, this really allows you to connect any API into NAN
6:17:41
and it's really awesome. So, that's going to be the first part of our HTTP
6:17:46
request. The second part is really going to dive in to real examples. I want to say we have like five or six different
6:17:54
examples that we're going to jump through. It's just so important that you get this concept down. Some of them, as
6:17:59
I mentioned, are going to be really easy. Some of them are going to be difficult. We're going to cover pageionation as well in there. And I
6:18:05
will see you soon. So, this next section, we're going to be covering four different APIs. Um, I asked Claude for
6:18:11
some examples of different ones to utilize. So, we're going to be taking a look at a very basic one, which is going
6:18:16
to look at countries. Uh there's no login over here and it's literally just a URL that we're going to be changing with our HTTP request. Then we're going
6:18:24
to take a look at using binary data. Now, I haven't tested this one at all, but hopefully it does work. And we're
6:18:30
going to be either getting pictures of cats or dogs and then passing it through. Our third example is going to
6:18:35
actually build out a workflow with an API. This one's going to be using weather. So, we'll essentially build out
6:18:41
a workflow and test that out with the API in the middle of it. And then the last one is going to deal with
6:18:47
pageionation as well as a login. So we're going to be looking at different types of movies. So hopefully these will
6:18:53
give you some ideas of how to work with APIs in NA. And obviously this isn't a full extensive list of every single
6:19:00
option. There's a lot of them. And if you want more practice with using APIs, I have about two hours worth of content
6:19:06
on the channel teaching about the HTTP request node. So the three videos I would recommend that you take a look at
6:19:13
first. watch the rest API video about 20 minutes long. Then we have a video
6:19:18
specifically on the HTTP request node. Some of the REST principles are covered there, but it's an hourong video. We go
6:19:25
over a bunch of different structured examples um as well as like different types of login and things like that.
6:19:30
Highly recommend you watch that one. And then we have examples of pageionation which covers two different examples over
6:19:36
there based off of TV shows. Um one being Pokemon and then one being I think
6:19:41
Rick and Morty. So, those are other examples. You know, this isn't going to click right away. I completely
6:19:47
understand it. So, it's going to use some testing to get this to work properly. You learn by doing. So, check
6:19:54
those out. Um, another thing to mention with APIs and things like that. Typically, you're going to know what you
6:20:01
want to use within the API before. Um, so, for example, if you're using a CRM, you already kind of know like, hey, I
6:20:07
want to use a CRM to update contacts in bulk. So you would just search the documentation for that. In this case, I
6:20:13
don't even know what these APIs have minus their names. So we're going to be kind of diving through that documentation. Some documentation is
6:20:19
great. Some documentation is very poor. So you can also kind of search online whether you want to use an LLM or you
6:20:25
can use like a Stack Overflow to see if people have other ideas based around that. Uh other things to note the the
6:20:32
four examples I mentioned may have to do a pivot in case like an API is down. Those no longer exist or is now paid.
6:20:39
They had to do a few minor pivots later on in this course based around this. But I know I'm recording this when I'm in my
6:20:45
20 plus lectures into this. So I waited a little bit but regardless hopefully
6:20:52
this goes well and let's take a look at these. So the first one we're going to
6:20:57
take a look at is going to be our rest countries. So, I'm make a note and uh yeah, we'll dive into that right now.
6:21:04
So, rest countries, we have our URL. This one I do know it works because I just tested it really quick because I
6:21:10
knew it was going to be shortly after the intro. And uh it's going to be a pretty easy one. So, taking a look at
6:21:15
the documentation over here, we can get information about countries and it says it's a restful API. So, it says
6:21:22
important information. The structure of V2 has been reverted. uh you can access the API over here, but in order to get a
6:21:29
fast response, you should filter by the results in the field you need. So, this gives you a good example of what we
6:21:35
specifically want over here as notes. And I recommend like if you're brand new to an API, take some notes because some
6:21:42
of this might save you time a little bit later on and way you don't have to go back and read it. Talks about
6:21:47
contributing, donations, things like that. Um, and it says you can check the fields MD file to get descriptions for
6:21:53
each field. So I might not know what every single field comes back as. So I want to take a look at this file over
6:22:00
here just to see what happens. So we have different field names over here. Let's say I don't know what CLC is. And
6:22:07
it says and actually it's CIOC. My mic's in the way. It says code of international Olympic Committee. Okay,
6:22:13
cool. Now I know the acronym. Hey, let's see another thing I might not know.
6:22:19
What is Genie? World Bank Genie Index. Someone might laugh at me for not knowing that. I generally don't know
6:22:25
what that is. Uh, okay. What else over here? I might not know. Uh, let's see.
6:22:32
This I assume was Latin long. That's what it is. But if you see lighting, you're like, "The heck is lighting?" So,
6:22:37
typically, you're going to have some sort of data fields that are mapped. Again, some APIs are going to do a great job. This does a pretty good good job
6:22:44
telling you about it. So, it says what version these are in. I think we're in version 3.1, as I mentioned, and it
6:22:50
tells you a description. So, I like this a lot. Some APIs don't even do that. So, big props to this one because it's free
6:22:56
and it tells us how to do that. Okay. So, then we jump into some other stuff over here as well. And the first one
6:23:02
over here is all. So, it says you must specify the fields that you need up to 10 fields. I believe we already put that
6:23:08
note in here. Okay. So, we sort of put that in here, but I'd still mention that as well. So,
6:23:16
let's just grab that and populate it.
6:23:21
All right, pretty basic. And then we have name. It says search by country name. So let's start this off by
6:23:28
searching by a country name. What we're going to do is grab our HTTP request. And we're just going to go off of what
6:23:35
they want. So first thing to note is typically in APIs, it'll tell you like, hey, use a get, use post, hash, put,
6:23:42
delete, whatever the case may be. And over here, it does not say it. So you're going to have to think about what I
6:23:47
covered in last lecture. What are we doing over here? Well, we're grabbing data from an external source. So, since
6:23:53
we're grabbing information, this is going to be a get. We're not creating data in any capacity. This data is
6:23:58
already stored over here. We're just getting our data. So, let's use a get request.
6:24:03
So, we have get and then what we need to do is take a look at the example. So, we
6:24:08
can go over here and grab this country, which is Germany, and we can paste that in over here. Now, it didn't mention
6:24:14
anything about authentication, and I know there's no authentication on here. So we don't have to worry about this
6:24:19
authentication section. So we don't need to do that and there's nothing to send with query parameters, headers or body.
6:24:25
This entire API is literally just based around this specific URL. So we can execute this step and you can see we get
6:24:32
all of this information about Germany. So again, if you don't know what something is, let's say like I don't
6:24:38
know what TLDD is. And obviously like we work in data and we use AI. We like we
6:24:43
should know what TLDD is, but you can go over here and look for TLD. And it says internet tople domain. So cool
6:24:50
documentation works pretty nice over there. Oh, I don't know what CCA2 is. Let's go into our documentation. CCA2
6:24:56
ISO 316 31661 alpha twolet country code. So again, you can just go back and forth
6:25:03
on that side of things if you necessarily want to take a look at it. And there's a ton of data over here. All
6:25:08
right. Well, let's take a look at a different country. Well, it says take a look at this country over here.
6:25:14
And let's see what happens. And this is Estonia. So, we see E as the domain,
6:25:20
which I've never I don't think I've ever been to an e website. Uh when I think of E, I think of electrical engineering I
6:25:26
graduated with. But have all this over here lat long borders, translations,
6:25:32
etc. All across the board we have the continents and this is pretty cool. What
6:25:37
we have over here as well is an example of name/name. So essentially it's just
6:25:42
saying we can change out this name for another official name if we want to. Okay. So next it says search by
6:25:49
country's full name. It can be common or official value. And you can see we have
6:25:54
Aruba over here. So, let's just do another HTTP request. I'm going to pick this one off and we'll just build out a
6:26:00
brand new one. So, a different way to search it and we'll go over here and let's say we
6:26:06
want to just search for country based off of this. So, you can see Aruba full text equals true and we have all of this
6:26:13
information over here. So, another way we could do this the difference right we
6:26:19
have either a name or a full name. So it says common or official value and just a
6:26:25
little bit different instead of just putting name we put name name and we put question mark at the end equals full
6:26:30
text equals true. Uh there's other options that we could do. I believe this would be over here as a query parameter
6:26:37
and we could take a look at that as well. So see this question mark and it says full text equals strobe. So in a
6:26:43
URL when you see a question mark this is going to be considered a query parameter. So we have this already. Let
6:26:49
me show you how we could send in a query parameter. So I'm just going to copy this over here. And we're going to use
6:26:54
the same exact thing. So I'm going to go over here and click send query parameters. And first thing I'm going to
6:27:00
do is remove all this. I'm going to go over here. We're going to keep that full name. And then we're going to keep this
6:27:06
true. So our value over here, and it's sorry, it's full text, not full name. So
6:27:11
the value of this query parameter, if you go back over here, it says full text equals true after this question mark. So
6:27:17
we just go into send query parameters, we put full text and we put true to emulate what we have and you'll see
6:27:22
we'll get the same exact results. So it works by keeping it in the URL or you
6:27:28
could have it even cleaner. So if you see that question mark that is a specific query parameter. Let's keep
6:27:33
moving forward. Over here we have this code. So this does not change like you
6:27:38
see we have the three different codes over here. This is our URLs. So we cannot change that out. List of codes.
6:27:45
So it says you can search any over here and we can go through that example as
6:27:50
well if we want to. This again will not be a query perimeter but we can just go through a HTTP request. We can test that
6:27:58
out. So get just paste that in. Super easy. And you can see we have four items
6:28:03
over here because we're taking a look at the matches of these specific codes. And I actually I lied. You can see over here
6:28:09
there's a question mark. Um so we actually do have codes we could search by which would be our query parameter. I
6:28:14
missed that because my mic was in the way. Uh, but this turned multiple items back. So, you can see it brought back
6:28:20
over here Estonia. It brought back Norway, it brought back Peru, and then
6:28:25
it also brought back Colombia. So, what I want you to do right now is pause this
6:28:32
and see if you can turn this into a query parameter. So, I'm just going to say change the above. So change the
6:28:40
above to a query par. So pause the
6:28:45
video. 3 2 1 and I'll be back with the solution. All right, I am back. So all
6:28:52
we're going to do is just copy this over. We're going to go in over here and
6:28:57
what we're going to do is click send query parameters. We're going to grab everything from that question mark
6:29:02
outwards. Move that. So we're going to say our codes equal. I'm going to grab the codes. I'm going to paste that over
6:29:08
here. I'm going remove that. I'm going to keep this fixed. Um, I'll show you expressions here in a second. But now
6:29:14
you can see we have these different codes we're searching by and we still get the same four results. So again,
6:29:20
just to reiterate that question mark, we can send that into the query parameter side of things. Um, currency, pretty
6:29:26
easy over here. Uh, what we have over here, I actually I want to run this for USD. I'm curious how many countries run
6:29:32
on the dollar. I believe a lot do. And I'm sure I'm getting some cringe
6:29:38
from people saying, "How do you not know this?" There's enough to know out there. All right. USD,
6:29:45
let's see, 20 items. So, not bad over there.
6:29:53
United States miner lang items, Caribbean, US. I'm surprised US wasn't number one
6:29:59
on this one. Puerto Rico, which is not a country, but I guess it's showing things
6:30:04
like that as well. W again, not a country, etc. Bahamas,
6:30:09
school. So, that is working over there. Let's see if there's anything else we could throw in. Again, there's a lot
6:30:15
that I would just recommend that you guys mess with. So, you can see there's sub regions,
6:30:21
translation. This has a lot of different fields. So, this filters a response. Let's actually
6:30:26
cover that one as well. So, it mentioned in the documentation earlier, you can search up to 10 fields. So, let's do the
6:30:33
default one and then I'll just have a a question for you guys to run with this.
6:30:40
So, let's take a look at that. What we're going to do is go over here is an
6:30:45
HTTP request and we'll just populate that in. So,
6:30:51
great. And you can see this is shortened quite a bit. All we do is name, capital, and currency. So, this brought 250 items
6:30:59
which is in their database. So, I actually want you to do something over here. First thing I want you to do is
6:31:06
set up a query pram. So, we're going to say I'll just put this over here. I guess
6:31:11
we'll do it side by side. It doesn't matter. So, number one,
6:31:16
turn into query param. And then what I want you to get for fields wise, let's
6:31:23
say we're a big sports fan and we want to get
6:31:29
FIFA. We want to get Olympics. What else was already in here?
6:31:36
Feel like we need to get the name. Yeah, let's get name and currencies.
6:31:43
Name and currencies. So, pause the video, try it out, and uh All right, I'm
6:31:50
back. We're going to try this first example. So, we're going to go over here and do that. So, now what we're going to
6:31:55
do is change this out. We're going to send our query parameters. We're going to grab this and we're going
6:32:01
to go to fields. So, you'll see fields over here and we're going to put in those values. So, name, currencies. This
6:32:09
will work pretty easily and uh we'll test it out. And I want to expand this out. Now, we're going to do a part two.
6:32:16
Um, so actually, sorry. I wanted to put an Olympic in FIFA, all that stuff. So,
6:32:22
we're going to go over here. Our Olympics was Where is that?
6:32:27
FIFA is what? Just FIFA. Yeah, FIFA. Where is this? Olympic one at
6:32:35
Olympics. CIO. So, because of that, I would have never guessed that, but we'll say CIO
6:32:42
FIFA. This should work. Just make sure that you keep it exactly how they want it. They just don't want any spaces.
6:32:48
Separate by comma. Cool. So, we have CISC. We have name. We
6:32:55
don't need that. We needed the currency, which I accidentally deleted, unfortunately. I apologize.
6:33:02
All right. So, it's currencies like that. Obviously, some countries have multiple currencies. All right.
6:33:07
Currencies, CIO, FIFA. So, that is working over here. Great. Hey, we have
6:33:12
turn 50 items. But you know what? I want to consolidate this. So I just want you to filter this in any sort of way. So
6:33:20
part two is to filter this in any way.
6:33:25
This in any way because we've already talked about different ways that you could filter. I just literally want you
6:33:30
to filter something out. So pause the video, give it a shot, and I'll give you the solution. Ready? Three, two, one.
6:33:38
All right, I'm back. Let's cover that solution. So, I'm just going to literally copy the same thing. And I want to go to my dollar example. Where's
6:33:45
my dollar? I'm looking for 20 items. And I guess all these kind of go down. So,
6:33:50
I'm just going to go into our API. I'm going to find that dollar one as well.
6:33:57
It was Well, actually, let's do language. We'll do language instead. So, I'll go over here and go to our HTTP
6:34:04
request. How about for every English country? So, we're going to go over here and go to this URL. And I'm just going
6:34:10
to copy that. And instead of lang cop, I'm going to say English. Hopefully
6:34:15
that's exactly what it should be. And I want to get the name currencies uh Olympic and FIFA for all the English-speaking countries. So this is
6:34:22
running. It's a little slow right now. So maybe there's something on the API side of things. You saw some of them were pretty instant. This one is taking
6:34:30
a little bit. So when this is done, I'll be right back. I might pause it and restart this just because of that. And
6:34:37
this does happen time to time. I think a little bit later on in the course, well, I know later on in the course, we're
6:34:43
going to be talking about what happens if an API fails, a little bit outside the side of things, but you can see we
6:34:48
got 91 items back. So, really cool. I showed you how to filter with this URL. Showed you how we can send query
6:34:54
parameters to specify the specific fields. Um, you know, the other thing
6:34:59
that's interesting is some of these are empty. So, we could take this a step further and we're like, hey, we just want to get the Olympics countries.
6:35:06
Maybe not all these countries compete in the Olympics. So what you would want to do to add in a filter and what we're
6:35:13
going to do is look for our CIOC.
6:35:18
We have native name. We don't care about CIOC. So we're going to go over here value and we're going to say string is
6:35:25
not null. So is not empty. And you can see we kept 68 items and these 23 do not uh compete.
6:35:34
I've never heard of Hollywood of Jersey. I don't know everything obviously, but never heard of that.
6:35:42
Interesting. Um, but yeah, so we have all that over here. These got filtered out. These 68 compete in Olympics. So
6:35:48
that's the way uh we've taken the API. We've taken the API, we filtered it down, and then we even filtered it again
6:35:54
after a note. Very, very common to do in real workflows. Trying to see if there's anything else that's really worth
6:35:59
mentioning. I mean, we learned a lot already with this first example. I'm just going to save this as like API one.
6:36:07
We'll just go through the other APIs and just build this out so that way it doesn't get confusing. So when you guys
6:36:14
download this, if you download this in our school group, uh all of that will be over there. So I'm just going to say um
6:36:20
countries API countries API part one. And then I'll
6:36:26
save this and we'll cut into part two shortly. All right, we're going to be taking a
6:36:31
look at part two now. So, I'm just going to say HTTP requests um 13 part two and we're going to be
6:36:39
taking a look at dog CEO. So, I'm going to go over here and grab this
6:36:47
and uh let's throw this in. Cool. So, I'm going to close out our
6:36:53
country's data and we're going to take a look at this for the first time. So, some APIs are going to return back
6:36:59
images, and you might want to know how to work with them in workflows. We've talked about binary files before. So,
6:37:05
this over here says, "The internet's biggest collection of open- source dog pictures. Read our documentation to find out more." And it says, "Want to add
6:37:11
your dog to the collection? Submit photos as a poll request here." And need more dog in your life? Get issue one dog
6:37:18
CEO design early business and lifestyle magazine for modern dog. It's crazy. Um,
6:37:23
and you can see over here we can fetch a random dog every time that we populate this, which is going to be pretty cool.
6:37:28
And then we have our documentation over here. And we have our JSON based
6:37:34
around all of this. So we can actually paste in JSON, which is amazing. We can get all of the dog breeds over here. We
6:37:41
can get a random image as another thing by breed, by subre, browse breed list.
6:37:46
So a lot going on over here and it's going to be a little bit different. So, I think just basic, we're going to go
6:37:53
back over here to the dog API. Let's first try this out and get a random. So,
6:38:00
all we should do, and feel free to test this out yourself. We're go over here and grab this HTTP. So, we're going to
6:38:06
say http. Obviously, I can't spell today, but that's fine. Uh, we'll grab that and
6:38:13
we'll get going. So, what we're going to do is it's fine. We can have our manual. We can grab this and paste in our image
6:38:22
at random. And uh we see a message and we got our random image. It says
6:38:28
success. So let's actually take a look at what this image looks like. And you can see it looks like this right over
6:38:34
here. That is a weird dog. Sorry if that's your dog, but probably not. Um
6:38:39
okay. So that's cool and all, but like we don't really get anything out of it. How how can we actually view this?
6:38:46
There's a few things we can do. We can actually go to HTTP requests like here and check this out. This is pretty cool.
6:38:51
Um, we can pass in this message over here. So, we have this link to an image
6:38:57
and if I execute this data, we have binary data. So, this is pretty amazing
6:39:02
because check this out. Instead of having to go to that URL, we get that URL directly in over here. So, if I want
6:39:08
to run this again, we're going to execute this workflow and go back in
6:39:14
view it. We have another dog. we uh do the same thing again. We'll go back over
6:39:20
here, get a new dog as well. So just in two nodes, what we did is we went into this
6:39:26
API, we got a random image of a dog, and then we have binary data that we can mess with. And you know, we could change
6:39:32
our binary name data name. We can go to edit set and let's say we go over here
6:39:39
and manual mapping. We'll go over here and say binary data. And this is called
6:39:44
data. And let's change this into dog. So I actually had it flipped. We're going to call this data over here. We're going
6:39:50
to call this dog as the new name. And you can see we reabeled this over here. So this is now dog. Again, same image
6:39:57
back and forth. We've labeled this over here. And we can pass obviously binary files into a Google Drive or wherever
6:40:05
else we want to populate them. But now we have our binary file. We go to this URL. We get image of a dog. We get this
6:40:14
into our workflow by just pasting in this image URL. And this is another hack of an HTTP request. I don't think I
6:40:20
talked about it in the previous videos, but you can just paste in an image URL. And now you have a binary file within
6:40:27
your workflow. Pretty cool. All right, so that's our random, which is the basic one. This is super super easy. But let's
6:40:33
take a look at the documentation. So what we first have is list all breeds. Let's take a look at that. So maybe you
6:40:40
want to see what all the breeds are like. We'll go to our HTTP request and we'll just paste this in. So, we're
6:40:47
going to see all of our specific breeds and we have all the names over here. So, a lot of these I've never heard of
6:40:54
before. I have an Australian Shepherd like that. And I also have a golden
6:41:00
retriever. And uh where's our golden retriever at?
6:41:07
Maybe it's under retriever. I don't see. Oh, yeah. Retriever right
6:41:13
over here. And you see golden. So, we can also search by those specifically if we really wanted to. And you know,
6:41:21
there's some that are easier than others. If we go into this list,
6:41:26
I don't know why you have these over here or you have the ones that are in particular down below on that side of
6:41:32
things. So, again, a few different options over there. And uh yeah, so
6:41:38
let's take a look also at our documentation. So this lists all the different breeds and you can see how
6:41:44
that is built out. So this can be pretty helpful if you want to just search for a specific breed. You have the random
6:41:51
image which we've already covered. You also have by breed. So you can take a look at this and maybe let's start
6:41:57
trying to figure out how we could change this out. So, I'm going to close that out over
6:42:03
here and we're going to go to another HTTP request. So, HTTP request like that. And uh yeah, we'll jump in over
6:42:11
here. So, taking a look at this, let's just paste in our URL. Again, this is a
6:42:16
get because we're just grabbing an image. We're not generating anything. And this gives us a bunch of different
6:42:21
images based around hounds. And actually, there's so many I didn't expect all this to populate. 87
6:42:27
different images that have been uploaded. And obviously you can change out the different breed. We already saw
6:42:34
how we can get all these type of breeds. Um going back over here, you can see this is hound Afghan. And if we go back
6:42:40
over here to breeds, um we can do this also another way. But you can see hound
6:42:45
Afghan. So maybe I want to change this into a Australian shepherd. So we'll go to Australian like that and go to
6:42:53
shephardd and uh go over here and just make this Australian first. So you can
6:42:58
execute the step. Then we have all of these over here for the Australian side of things. So you can see Australian Kelpy or Australian Kelpy. Then we have
6:43:06
Australian Shepherd over here. So we have all these over here. Maybe we want to break these out and then filter them
6:43:12
out. So we go into our nodes and I've already taught you the data transformations on these. So we can just
6:43:18
split all these out from the message. So now instead of having one binary file or
6:43:24
it's not one binary file but one item for all these across the board now we have 13 different URLs. So you can see
6:43:33
right over here we go to table we have these 13 and maybe I want to filter it out. So just show Australian shepherds.
6:43:39
So I can filter on this side of things and we'll say our message over here text string it needs to contain and we're
6:43:46
going to say it has to contain shepherd. So shepherd like this. And now uh we
6:43:51
don't have any of them because I obviously misspelled shepherd which is embarrassing. But now we have five
6:43:58
Australian shepherds over here. Forest Leroy Pepper Pepper 2 and then also Saddy. So we've taken essentially our
6:44:07
API that has all these images. We split this out based off of a filter on
6:44:12
Australian dogs. We got 13 items and then we just filtered for Australian
6:44:17
Shepherd. So we have that and this is by breed. We could also have done this
6:44:22
easily with by subre. So you can see over here it
6:44:28
says breed images. We can go over here by subre. We can take a look at a little bit more information over here. List all
6:44:34
subread images. So instead of using what I just did over here
6:44:40
and I want to go to an HTTP request, just jump over here and we'll go over
6:44:46
here. I'll say Australian. Then I'll grab Shepherd, which I
6:44:52
obviously misspelled it the first time, so I don't want to misspell it again. I'll just go over here like that and
6:44:58
paste that in. Get our images. You'll see we have our five. And again, if you want to split these out so that they are
6:45:05
their own URLs, you have this like that. So there's always multiple ways to do things. Like I think this is the more
6:45:11
efficient route rather than passing in all 13 and then just filtering it out for uh shepherds like I put over here.
6:45:18
Like documentation tells us how we could go for the subreeds. Obviously I didn't
6:45:23
see that initially but we have that over here. You can also get a single random image from a subre. So we can grab that
6:45:30
if we wanted to. Might as well do that one really fast.
6:45:35
This is like a very very easy API. Again, we're just kind of getting our feet wet. We went through a basic one
6:45:41
for our countries, and this one over here just lets us work with binary files. Wish there was a little bit more
6:45:48
um advanced stuff with this one, but that's okay. And you can see we get a random image every time for this one
6:45:54
over here. Um again, you could go and this into a binary file if you want to.
6:46:01
I'm not really going to work with that that side. Um multiple images. So, you can grab multiple images as well. just
6:46:08
paste in that extra number here at the end. It's pretty easy there. Um, browse
6:46:14
breed list. So, we already kind of taken a look at this with our API on that side of things. And this is pretty
6:46:19
self-explanatory. That is going to be the dog API. I don't really have any challenges with this. I guess the only
6:46:25
challenge like if you want to and I'm not going to do it, but like I'll just put this as an extra credit assignment.
6:46:32
So, lot of note like extra credit. If you want to be a a good student, you'll say
6:46:40
extra credits, you know, build a workflow
6:46:45
where we pass this data into a Google Drive.
6:46:52
See if you can do that. I think it would be fun for you to learn how to do it. It's honestly just a few extra nodes and uh
6:46:59
this will tell you if you're really picking up stuff. I mean I already did bulk of the effort over here and maybe you want to do this by a specific subre
6:47:07
like choose a random one or you want to send all of them it doesn't really matter. Choose your approach. Um oh one
6:47:14
other thing I wanted to show you really fast and this will be extra after the extra credit or before. So we've
6:47:22
ideally gone through all this. So we've gone through breeds. So you might be wondering like, okay, how do we make
6:47:28
this a little bit more dynamic? Because like we have this breed over here, Australian. So let me grab this over
6:47:35
here. It's this one. Like, okay, you've been hard coding all
6:47:41
this extra stuff. Well, all we have to do is have an edit set. So I'm going to
6:47:46
go and use a retriever for an example. So let's say I go over here by breed.
6:47:52
I'm going to search for broadbreed list. Where's our retriever is at? This isn't
6:47:59
in order. Or is this? No, it's not in order. That's annoying. We'll go back over here. List all breeds. I'm just
6:48:05
going to search for retriever really quick. I know I could just over here. We're going to get our golden retriever.
6:48:11
So, what I'm going to do is go into this. I'm going to set something
6:48:17
called breed. And we can imagine like you could have a form that lets someone choose something.
6:48:22
And maybe we'll do that as like a part two here in a second. So now what I want to do is go in here. I'm going to set
6:48:29
this as an expression. I'm going to execute the previous node. And instead of this Australian over here, what I'm
6:48:35
going to do is paste in this JSON retriever. So you can see we can pass in JSON in
6:48:42
these URLs. And we can do the same thing with query parameters, body, headers. We can pass in JSON from previous nodes.
6:48:49
And you can see we now have retrievers. So to take this a step further, right? And I'm just going to deactivate this
6:48:56
and delete it. Uh let's imagine we have a form. So you can go any end form.
6:49:01
And uh we'll do a trigger. We'll say um dog image creator.
6:49:08
Creator. Obviously, it's not a creator, but it's fine. Field name, we'll say like breed.
6:49:15
And then we'll put dog breed over here. We'll have that as text. So, I'm just
6:49:21
going to copy that. I'm going to paste this in over here.
6:49:26
And what we're going to say this time is, let me just grab this over here. I don't want to misspell it. And then have
6:49:33
it not work. I'm going to execute the step. Dog breed. I'm going to say it's a retriever. So, we have our retriever
6:49:39
over here as breed. And then I'm just going to p paste that in. So it' be the
6:49:44
same thing over here, right? The JSON.breed. I'll just show you that like it's not changing. Um, but now we get this on the form. And now we have this
6:49:51
dynamic. So anytime this form is submitted, we can change the dog breed. I can go over here and let's say I want
6:49:58
to run this now for Australian. So we're going to say Australian. Submit it. You'll see now we have our
6:50:06
five Australian shepherds. We put that over there. So this really kind of just expands it out when you add in that
6:50:12
dynamic element to the HTTP request. Again, I would recommend you do this as like extra credit, feel free like if you
6:50:18
want to start with an edit set or a form or chatbot, like whatever you want really. And uh just uh build this out
6:50:25
where you can save it into Google Drive. It's really easy. I'm not going to show it to you because I want you to try and
6:50:31
do this on your own. And we'll be back with our next API which is going to be
6:50:37
open weather. So, what we're going to do with this one, it's going to be pretty cool, is we're actually going to build out even more of a an end workflow.
6:50:43
We're going to send an email based off of the weather and yeah, we'll have some fun with it. All right, I will see you
6:50:49
in the next part, which is part three. All right, so we're on example three now. So, let me make that note. Section
6:50:58
13, example three. And what we're taking a look at is the open weather API. and you
6:51:05
know based off of what we have in here. We're actually going to build a workflow around it. So let's take a look at
6:51:12
what's going on. So first we have how to get started. This page is comprehensive guide to get access to capability to
6:51:18
open whether it's APIs from initial registration to making API calls. You'll find detailed instructions. All right.
6:51:24
So first thing it says how to start with our API. Uh start with our services easy. So sign up and get API key. So, we
6:51:31
need to actually sign up. And uh we'll just test these out over
6:51:37
here. Not a robots. Great. And I'm going to
6:51:44
just fill this out. And uh this is going to get cut out, but I'll be right back. All right. So, now we have how and where
6:51:51
you'll use our API. And uh let's see if we have an option over here.
6:51:59
guess other because it's like there's nothing for Oh, education and science.
6:52:06
I'm just gonna click save. Cool. All right. And now what we need to
6:52:11
do is just check the email or go to Gmail really quick. And I'm
6:52:17
going to check my email to see if I got this or not. And I did get our
6:52:23
confirmation. So you'll get your confirmation like this. And then I'll just verify my
6:52:29
email. Right, we've been verified. I don't know what the pricing is. I
6:52:35
would assume there's free pricing. Okay, first 10,000 API calls per day are
6:52:42
free. Great. So, this should be fine for us. Um, but obviously there's historical
6:52:47
data up to 46 years. Like note that the subscription requires
6:52:53
pay as you go. Obviously, there's other things over
6:52:58
here. I think we should be fine with our first one for free.
6:53:04
Hopefully, it allows us to go. I don't want to pay. This is the thing
6:53:10
with trying to find like free APIs and things like that. I don't want you to do some billing. So, maybe we're not going
6:53:17
to use this open weather. All right. So, actually, this is free access right here. So we can get current weather and
6:53:24
forecast or current forecast and historical data for education. So I think we should be able to get our API
6:53:30
key for this one for current weather. So I'm going to click get API key alert.
6:53:35
You're already signed in. All right. Let's see if we have an API key over here.
6:53:47
Um where is this at? All right, let's see if I have an API key.
6:53:54
Go to my API keys. And we have our API key here. It's blurred out on my screen so you guys
6:54:01
cannot see it. My editor will do that. And we will
6:54:07
test this out and see if we can get that free version. Hopefully that's the case.
6:54:12
Obviously, I don't want you guys to pay. So, we're going to do an HTTP request, and we'll set this up here in a second
6:54:19
based off of the documentation. Um, all I did again is I went to the API. I
6:54:24
found that free section, which it looks like it's gone from my side now
6:54:31
for like the current weather, but unless it was on the pricing page.
6:54:39
I think it was the pricing page. All right. So, current weather and forecast. We need to find that
6:54:46
documentation. So, we're going to go to guides, open link,
6:54:53
and let's find the current weather.
6:55:03
All right. So, current weather and forecast, real time updates every 10 minutes.
6:55:11
Current weather data. This is the one that we want to take a look at. So, we're going to look at the API doc.
6:55:17
Great. I think we're in the right spot. And you can see like this is an example of a much more comprehensive API. So,
6:55:23
what we have over here is our example. So, it says HTTP equals we need to put our lat long and
6:55:30
our API key. So, these are all required parameters. So, you can see it says required latitude over here. Required
6:55:37
longitude and uh this is an example of the API call. So, typically what I like to do is
6:55:44
start with an example. And you'll see we get a JSON response associated with it.
6:55:49
Um, where is this at? Let's do a flat and longitude of a city. So, you know,
6:55:57
obviously it's 12:31. New Year's is about to hit in uh the states
6:56:03
in less than 12 hours. There's the big New Year's ball in New York. So, let's say the long and long of New York City.
6:56:12
that is going to be this. So, this is the Latin long of NYC. Let's uh paste
6:56:18
this in over here. So, what we're going to do is take a look at that.
6:56:27
Cool. So, this is the Latin long of New York City. We're going to get this example over here. So, this is an
6:56:32
example of an API call and we'll grab that over here as well.
6:56:39
So, we'll just throw that in that. Great. So, this is our URL and
6:56:46
we've already kind of covered our specific URLs. We can change this up as needed, but let's uh grab that first.
6:56:55
And you can see also with the example, let me just go back over here. All we're
6:57:00
doing is changing these parameters because if you go to this,
6:57:08
you'll see all they're doing for the lat is putting this lat with two decimal
6:57:13
places. This is ann with two decimal places. So with our New
6:57:18
York example, it' be 40.71 that. And then I'll just put like a a
6:57:25
bracket or not bracket but a colon like that column I say colon like that. Okay,
6:57:32
cool. So now let's test that out with our thing. So I'm going to go over here
6:57:40
and change that up. So we're going to do 40.71. I just find this easier just to manipulate this out over here for a
6:57:46
second just so you guys see what I'm doing. 74 in like that. Then I need to put in my
6:57:53
API key, which I will put in a second. If I can delete my API key, I'll probably just use the API key for this
6:57:59
example. Just going to go to API key really fast.
6:58:09
Let's see. Okay, I'm just going to deactivate my key after this section. So, it's showing. That's fine. I don't
6:58:16
really care. I'm going to grab my key like this, and I'm just going to paste it in over here.
6:58:22
So you'll see that is my API key and uh yeah we'll test this out and obviously this is not secure like if we
6:58:29
share this workflow with any other person they can access our API key because any end will save this over
6:58:35
here. So I'm going to have to show you how we can get rid of this API key within this section. Um yeah we'll we'll
6:58:42
cover that here in a minute. So I'm going to execute this step and it says invalid API key. Unfortunately we have
6:58:49
something going on with our API key. Uh, that's annoying. All right, let's see
6:58:57
why this is not working.
6:59:05
The status is active. Why is this not working though?
6:59:13
There are API key. We did the exact example.
6:59:20
Let's see this error. So, it tells us where we can see this error. 401, you did not specify your API key and API
6:59:26
request. Your API key is not activated yet. Within the next couple of hours, it'll be activated, ready to use. Well,
6:59:32
we are might have to wait. You're using free subscription. Try requesting data
6:59:39
available in your subscription for example. All right. Maybe it's we have to go to
6:59:46
2.0. Let's try 2.0. No,
6:59:51
no, this API is not ready. Unfortunately, we're going to wait on this.
6:59:57
All right. So, essentially, I did a little bit more research on this 401 error. I'm going to keep this in the
7:00:04
video because this is kind of real world debugging, like what's happening with an API key. I found this on Stack Overflow,
7:00:11
which if you're not familiar with Stack Overflow, it's a really great place for developers to take a look at information. So I literally just Google
7:00:18
search open weather map error 401 and uh someone has already said this is
7:00:23
a duplicate error. They have code over here to specifically jump into the API
7:00:29
and someone says check this out. Reasons why your API key is not working. Also it takes two hours for key activation. Um
7:00:38
take a look at this. This is from 10 years ago and someone also mentions that it takes two hours for our key to work.
7:00:46
So unfortunately or fortunately
7:00:51
and this is not going to work for us for 2 hours. I want to get this course to
7:00:57
keep moving forward. So I'm going to pretend like this actually works and we'll still work walk through the
7:01:03
documentation. Maybe you want to wait the two hours and come back to this lecture. Um we're going to still cover
7:01:08
another API in that next side. I think this was a good example though of showing you like some things are out of
7:01:14
your control like waiting two hours is out of my control on this because I wanted to go into these APIs a little
7:01:20
bit blind but that's a bummer as you can see I was looking at the 401 errors and things
7:01:27
like that. So going back into like what we expect to receive, you know, we could
7:01:34
still build out a workflow just based off of predictions. Like we can obviously just edit our values and
7:01:40
things like that. We can still talk about other stuff as well. Um so documentation wise, let me kind of
7:01:46
explain a few things. When you are looking at um documentation for an API,
7:01:51
if they mention that a parameter is required, you have to put that in there. Otherwise, you're going to get an error.
7:01:56
As you can see over here, lat long app ID is required. Optional means you don't necessarily need to pass it on, but you
7:02:03
can do that if possible. Uh so you can see this is lat long. It's easy. App ID
7:02:09
is unique API key. It shows you where you can get your API keys. Mode optional is a response format. Possible are XML
7:02:16
or HTML. If you don't use the mode format is JSON by default. I'm fine with JSON. So that's good there. I wouldn't
7:02:22
pass in mode. Optional, units of measurement, standard, metric, or imperial. Obviously, this depends on the country that you're at. And then it says
7:02:29
language optimal, you can change this output in your language. So, if you're overseas and you don't want to have this in English, you can change that
7:02:35
language. And you would just keep passing these on. So, you can see what we have over here is this question mark.
7:02:40
So, we can pass that data specifically on in our our query parameter section.
7:02:46
So, to show you how that would work, we'll go over here and
7:02:52
next. And you can take a look. We have our question mark. So what we want to do is send query parameters and we'll add
7:02:58
in multiple parameters this time because we didn't cover that on the last side of it. So we're going to take that question
7:03:04
mark and we're going to paste that over here. And first thing we have is lat. So
7:03:09
we're going to keep this to 40.71. Then we're going to do our long width is
7:03:14
74. So I'll just put name long should be long like that. Put the value over here
7:03:21
74.00. And then we have our app ID, which is our uh API key. Now, I do not recommend
7:03:29
you put your API key over here. I'm just going to clean this up. Just show you that. So, I do not recommend that you
7:03:37
put your API key here. And I'll explain here in a second. I'm just clean that up. I noticed I had an error. So, you
7:03:43
can see I took lat, I put a value 4071, lawn, I put a value 74, and then app ID.
7:03:48
And again, we saw that because there was a question mark in here, we could use these as specific query parameters. So
7:03:54
what I would recommend that we do is set some sort of authentication up for this app ID because it's just not the best
7:04:01
approach to use when we share this workflow. Someone else will be able to get our value even if it's right here or
7:04:07
if it is right down below over here. So same if you do headers or body um if you
7:04:14
have your API key in over there typically won't be in body but you sometimes you'll see header anyone can access it. So what we want to do is go
7:04:20
into authentication, set up a generic credential type, and then what we're going to do is look for a query off.
7:04:27
Okay. Then what we're going to do is create a new credential and we're going to say like this is open
7:04:33
weather. So open weather. And then we need the name. So we go back
7:04:40
into our stuff and we'll edit this here in a second. I'm just clicking save. You'll notice it says name is app ID. So
7:04:46
going to open weather, we'll call this app ID like that. Save it again. And then we grab our value. So we go back in
7:04:53
over here. And then we paste in our value there. So now we have our credentials to open weather saved. And
7:05:00
you can see it obviously saves over here. Um we have this saved directly in our HTTP request. And now I would
7:05:06
recommend that you delete this over here. So now all we have to pay paste in every time is our lat and long to get
7:05:13
this API working. Whereas we just have to choose this query authentication over here. We choose a generic type a query
7:05:20
off because that's where it defined it in the API. We saw that with the question mark. We just go over to query
7:05:26
off like that and then set it up. Okay. Again, app ID. It tells us this directly
7:05:32
in our documentation. So if we go to our documentation again, wherever that's at
7:05:38
here, it says and app ID like this. We have this after a question mark. So we
7:05:43
know that that's a query. Uh we put the app ID and we paste in our specific value. Obviously I would show it to you
7:05:49
guys but we can't work on this for two hours. So is why this is not currently working. And uh happy to take a look at
7:05:56
this a little bit later after the video uploads if there's any issues on that side of things. But yeah so I wanted to
7:06:02
show you that. The other question you might have is like okay well if I save this over here as a actual a query off
7:06:08
and a generic credential if I share my workflow will other people have access to it? And the answer is no. This is
7:06:13
based off of your specific credentials. So if you share this, all they'll have
7:06:18
access to now is this LAT and long. They will not have access to your API key. So this is the most secured way to do it.
7:06:24
Uh you set up a credential type. Obviously you want to see if something's available in predefined. Otherwise you
7:06:30
do a generic credential and uh like let's say predefined. I don't think open weather is going to be over here. It's
7:06:37
the exact name, right? Open weather. Yeah. So, I'd look first to see if open weather is here or not. Um, it actually
7:06:44
is. So, you can see open weather map API create a new credential and you can just
7:06:49
paste this in up over here. That is the same thing or the route that I did. And
7:06:56
just to create the credential here, put my access token that side of it which I
7:07:02
have that do I have it saved over here? I do. So, two different routes that you could go if it's not available.
7:07:10
It's not available in a predefined credential. Paste that. There it says couldn't
7:07:16
connect with these. We already know why it's not going to connect because of the two hours. We'll assume it does.
7:07:22
You can set that up as a predefined. Otherwise, if it is not in predefined, I recommend you do generic. You see based
7:07:28
off the documentation. This documentation said it's a query. And then I just set it up directly in here. just following app ID and then value.
7:07:35
Hopefully that makes sense. That was kind of one of the big things I wanted to cover on the side because I knew we had to log in some capacity. The other
7:07:42
thing is I wanted to build a workflow. So you can imagine on the side of it like we get our values back.
7:07:50
We'll get some JSON. So what I want to do is just copy this JSON.
7:07:57
We're going to do is pretend to paste this in a HTTP request. So we're going to go here and I'm going to click edit
7:08:05
and I'm g just paste this in.
7:08:10
So you can see this would be our example. So it says this data is test for pinned executions. We have our
7:08:16
coordinates. We have the weather temperature feels like which seems way
7:08:22
off. Temp 282.
7:08:28
I'm reading that right? Temp 280 284. What the heck?
7:08:37
That's weird. That seems off.
7:08:42
Is this just like a fake thing? No, this is a real thing in Italy. I'm
7:08:49
sure I'm getting roasted. Why is it showing the temp in 284? Let's take a look. Temperature unit
7:08:58
default is Kelvin. That explains a lot. I'm like, man, why is it so off
7:09:04
Kelvin to Fahrenheit? I'll do Celsius in a second, too. Uh,
7:09:11
yeah, Kelvin Zero is the coldest thing possible. Uh, 48 degrees Fahrenheit.
7:09:16
It's freezing. Um, okay,
7:09:22
cool. and we'll do 282 for those that are in Celsius 8 degrees Celsius cold
7:09:28
weather at least here in Florida. All right, regardless, not to go on a tangent, I don't know why Kelvin didn't
7:09:34
click for me in a second. I know what Kelvin is, but you just I I would have expected that this would have populated
7:09:40
either in Celsius or Fahrenheit. All right, so we have all this data over here, and you can imagine like we can
7:09:47
essentially have, let's say, a database of all of our customers. So, this is
7:09:53
what I was going to work on specifically, and obviously like it's it's not possible based off of this. Right now, we have a database of
7:09:58
customers, which I'm just going to put in um Google Sheets. So, we'll say
7:10:04
Google Sheets. And then what I was going to do is run this API based off of
7:10:12
location. So, let's say if they're in Florida or like Orlando, Florida, I'm out. Okay. What's the temperature over
7:10:18
here? What's the temperature where else? and then either get this data would have like some sort of if node. So let's I
7:10:26
don't know why I type in if node. We would have an if node over here and then like one route like okay if
7:10:33
this is going to be based off of the temperature or weather. So temperature or if it's raining
7:10:40
and then based off of this we can promote a product. So like imagine if it's cold so for example if it's
7:10:47
freezing in Florida. in Florida promotes a jacket.
7:10:54
Hey, so essentially this was my goal for this side of it. Obviously, it's not going to happen for the two hours. Um,
7:10:59
we have database of customers. Let's imagine this is in Google Sheets. We build this out. Then we run the HTTP
7:11:04
request to get the current weather and locations. So now we have the customer, we have okay, how cold is it in their
7:11:10
specific area. I'll just convert this from Kelvin into Fahrenheit. Um, I believe the API also mentioned we could
7:11:17
change that out. So, uh, we would go into the temperature or if it's raining.
7:11:22
I didn't decide which one I was going to do for this video, but we can go with the temperature idea. So, if it's like
7:11:27
under 50° Fahrenheit, I have a e-commerce store that sells jackets. I want to promote that. So, I'm going to
7:11:34
say um, an email to these customers. Hey, it's freezing in Orlando. Um, buy a
7:11:39
jacket, which it is cold today. It's actually, uh, 45° out, which is very cold for us here in Florida. And yeah,
7:11:46
that was essentially the workflow I was going to build out for this video with you guys. Unfortunately, that's not the case. If you want to test it out, go for
7:11:52
it. Uh, see what you can build. I think you have all the skills to build this out. As of now, I showed you how to set
7:11:57
this up. Uh, other thing I just want to quickly go through to see if there's anything else that's interesting. I
7:12:02
remember how I mentioned we're going to get these fields. So, you can see over here, unit default, Kelvin, metric,
7:12:08
Celsius, imperial, Fahrenheit. Found out really fast when I went into this documentation, right? Like I had Why is
7:12:14
this 280? That seems off and I thought they were going to give us some fictitious information at first. Well, it's in Kelvin. Uh you can see feels
7:12:22
like temperature parameter accounts for the perception of weather in Florida. It can get really really hot based off of
7:12:28
that. Also, we're super humid over here. You see wind values, cloud values. So, if you really want to get some more
7:12:34
information about how this API works is all available over here. I just recommend that you get your responses
7:12:40
back in JSON. Uh there's other information over here as well. A list of weather condition codes. So if you want
7:12:46
to see the codes, they're all over here. Gives you some other icons and information as well. And uh yeah,
7:12:54
there's also options for bulk downloading that site too. A little bit more info. Uh what else do we have?
7:13:01
Built-in API request by city name. So this is pretty cool. We can actually do uh city as well and instead of long that
7:13:08
long. So this would just say over here the Q is required. So city name, state
7:13:16
code and country code divided by a comma. So this seems like a little bit extra work. There's probably an example
7:13:22
here. Oh actually we just had to put in London I guess London UK like that is there's I think a London Canada. Um
7:13:29
built an API request by city ID. If you know the city ID on top of your head and maybe we want to build this out in a database and go through again you can
7:13:36
see required versus optional which you now learned about in this section and uh yeah I think this is pretty good
7:13:44
examples of API calls. So this is great tells you about different languages. This is a well doumented API. It's just
7:13:50
a bummer. It's going to take two hours if not more. Um some of the people that I saw in Stack Overflow mentioned that
7:13:57
they had to wait overnight for their API keys at times. Again, this is three years ago, so things can change. Um, but
7:14:04
I think it was kind of helpful for that. So, you know, just to kind of a recap on
7:14:09
here, if your API key doesn't work and you do get an error code, obviously try to research it. We saw that this takes
7:14:15
two hours. Um, not planned by any means like that. Uh, we also learned about
7:14:22
putting an API key over here in either the URL or query parameters. It is not
7:14:27
secured. So your best set is to set either a predefined credential or generic. By default, you should try to
7:14:33
take a look at predefined if it's existing. If not, you build out the generic credential.
7:14:39
And then I just kind of showed you an example over here. Albeit it just sticky notes of a workflow that I wanted to
7:14:45
build for this particular video. The next one's going to be taking a look at a movie database. Hopefully that doesn't
7:14:51
take too. If so, just go to a different API that I've already done with pageionation. But I think that's another
7:14:58
important concept to teach you guys and I'll see you in part four now. All right, here is our fourth one and what
7:15:03
we're taking a look at is the movie database. So I'm going to populate this in over here
7:15:11
and let's jump into it. So let's set up our API key. So it says you
7:15:17
don't have permissions. You have to log in. So I'm going to create an account over here. And uh register an account is
7:15:24
free and simple. Okay. Obviously, again, my first time trying this out. I'm going
7:15:29
to just pause the video really quick, and once I get signed up, we'll be ready to go. Then, it's going to say confirm
7:15:35
I'm human. We'll begin. Choose all the beds. We'll choose these beds over here. No complaints there.
7:15:42
And uh got that correct. Okay, you're verified. So, sorry, I'm not verified yet. So, I need to verify. I'm just
7:15:49
going to verify on my other screen.
7:15:55
activate my account. Cool. All it was is a uh
7:16:02
basic thing like this. I just called my username right Ann. So you can see movie. Great. All right. So now I just
7:16:09
need to log in. Logged in over here. And we have uh
7:16:15
TMDB. So we have all this information over here. And now we need to access the API.
7:16:24
So let's go back in over here and let's look at the API. All right. So offers a
7:16:30
API free for personal use. Please ensure you attribute TMDB for images data use.
7:16:36
You can find the logos. So obviously this is what I'm using for the video teaching you guys how to set this up. If
7:16:42
you're going to use this there uh generate API key click here. Is intent
7:16:47
for personal use? Yep, it is personal use. I'm teaching you guys how to do this. And uh yes,
7:16:56
developer plan, no free thing. We'll just say over here
7:17:02
if there's any billing, I'm just going to literally say um API tutorial.
7:17:09
I'm going to go YouTube.com. It's literally just education
7:17:17
teaching people how to use API.
7:17:23
All right, it's literally going to make me do the rest of this. I'm just going to
7:17:29
go over here, subscribe. All right, that's annoying. I have to put in my address and stuff like that. So, I'm going to do that really quick.
7:17:37
We're going to cut from the screen once it is ready to go. So, I filled out that form and then it says access your API
7:17:42
key details here. So now we have our API key both on that
7:17:48
side of things. Um I definitely want to blur this out so you guys cannot see
7:17:54
these API keys just in case I can't actually delete these API keys.
7:18:01
Doesn't look like there's a way to delete them. So
7:18:07
yeah, we're going to have to probably do that. But it says primary documentation is over here. So, we're going to look at the documentation now and uh yeah, these
7:18:16
keys are going to be blurred out. Okay, so getting started. So, we have a little bit of a different guide over here for
7:18:22
the API. It says, "Welcome to version three. We already registered. Please note the API registration process is not
7:18:28
optimized for mobile devices." Uh, agree to terms of use
7:18:33
configuration methods and uh we have our FAQ. What do I apply for an API key? What is
7:18:40
an SLA? Rappers. They're a commercial service. Obviously, if you're building out some type of app
7:18:46
that uses it, you're going to have to go to the commercial side of things. API is free for non-commercial purposes.
7:18:52
Obviously, this is TMDB's stuff. Does the API change? Yep, it talks about
7:18:58
changes. Can I make changes? Nope. All right. And let's take a look at some other
7:19:05
stuff. Popularity, movies. So popular is a fairly important metric,
7:19:13
number of votes, trending. Cool. So this is going to talk about road maps,
7:19:18
rappers, and libraries. Like there's a lot of stuff over here. And this might seem overwhelming at first. There's
7:19:24
authentication. Uh you can see over here we have a bearer token that's mentioned. So it says the default method to
7:19:31
authenticate is with your access token. If you head into your account page under API settings, you'll see a new token API
7:19:37
access token. The token is expected to be sent along over here. A simple curl using this method looks like the
7:19:42
following. So, we can use a curl request as well. Um, it's not curl request, but use a
7:19:50
curl. So, let's start with that because I feel like that's probably the easiest way to get started. So, we have our HTTP
7:19:56
request and we'll take a look at it. So jumping in over here, let's import in
7:20:04
curl. So it's going to start with a get and great. So we have our API movie
7:20:12
authentication and then you can see over here we have a header parameter this time. So the previous ones that we've
7:20:18
taken a look at are great parameters and that was with our API key in the last
7:20:23
one. This one actually you have to put this in a header parameter. So, it's interesting that it's over here. So, if
7:20:30
we want to take a look and define this every time, what we're going to do is first take a look at predefined. Uh,
7:20:37
we're looking at the movie DB. So, let's see if the movie DB is over here. So, I'm just going to type in movie. And you
7:20:43
can see like there's no movie in here. So, we're going to have to use a generic credential. Then, we're going to go into
7:20:49
header. Okay. So, now I'm going to create a brand new header. So, create this over here. I'm going to call this
7:20:56
movie DB like that. Movie DB. All right. I'm going to actually save that. I
7:21:03
apologize for moving out. I'm going to say movie DB like this. I'm going to
7:21:09
save it. And now we need to call this authorization. So, I'm going to go over
7:21:14
here, name this authorization. We'll save that. And then it says my bearer access token. And that was back on our
7:21:20
first page because it says over here the default method authenticate. If you head to your account page under API settings,
7:21:26
you see a new token listed API read access token. This token is expected to be sent as authorization header. So that
7:21:33
is our first one over here. It's obviously blurred on my screen right now. I'm going head back into n. I'm
7:21:39
going to go back into this movie off head and I paste this over here into value. It's a very long one and I saved
7:21:46
it. So we have that over here and now we can remove this authorization and don't have to send any specific
7:21:53
headers. So, this is just our first test to see if this is working correctly. I have no idea what this endpoint actually
7:21:59
does, but we're just going to execute step. And uh fortunately, you must be granted a key. We have a status code
7:22:05
issue. Wonder if we have the same thing where this takes a little bit longer to uh take a look at. I'm going to just
7:22:12
search this really fast. Would I have an error? I wonder also if they sent an email
7:22:19
based around it. All right, we're gonna
7:22:24
try the other key here in a second. So, I'm just going to go over here and
7:22:30
do another HTTP request. We're going to import in that curl.
7:22:36
So, go back over here
7:22:42
through this. All right. So, importing this over here. First thing
7:22:48
we're going to just try is pasting in our key like that. Again, it's blurred
7:22:53
so you guys can't see. And actually, you know what the error is? I guarantee this is the error.
7:23:02
Yep, I know exactly what the error is. All right, so this is a weird quirk and let me show you in a brand new one.
7:23:09
Okay, this sometimes happens and obviously I wasn't paying attention too
7:23:15
well. So going back over here, if we grab that curl request, you'll notice
7:23:21
that it says bearer, there's a space, and then it says access token. So when you set up your credentials, you need to
7:23:28
make sure at the beginning there's bearer space and then paste it in. So um I need to go back over here and then
7:23:36
edit this. So you see where this value is? We're going to go all the way to the left. I'm going to say bearer space. And
7:23:43
then we're going to save this. And now I bet you if I run this, it actually works. Well, let me uh copy our exact
7:23:52
one that we had over in this other one that we knew worked correctly. So, I'm going to copy my API key. It's a little
7:23:57
bit easier to read. And then I'm going to go in here and paste that in. I'm
7:24:02
going to click save. And now we're going to test it again. And you can see it works properly. So, when you go in over
7:24:09
here, make sure API key looks like this. So, it's and I'll show you one more time.
7:24:17
So, because this does happen time to time and it sometimes it does stump people.
7:24:25
It stumped me right there for a second. Well, I wouldn't say stumped. I figured out within like five minutes. But, all right. So, imagine your API key is like
7:24:33
this. All right. So, we have our bearer access token. That's our example, right? And let's imagine our API key equals 1 2 3 4
7:24:43
4 5. So essentially as your saved credential. So saved credential you need
7:24:49
to have this equal to bearer like this space
7:24:56
1 2 3 4 5. So whatever that key is that long string you need to paste that in
7:25:01
over here. And that is what is being saved over here in value. Obviously, the
7:25:07
name is authorization. You need to make sure that's the same. All right, so hopefully that makes sense. I'm going to clearing these out. And again, do not
7:25:14
save your stuff in this headers because anyone that can access your workflow will get those values and you don't want
7:25:20
to leak your key. So hopefully that makes sense. And uh I know I said that
7:25:26
twice, but super super important that you set this up. Again, this does happen time to time. So I'm actually really
7:25:31
glad I made that error. And uh yeah, we'll keep going forward. Great. So authentication we've already covered
7:25:38
that as well and using the API. So now what we're going to have is different
7:25:44
examples over here and what we can take a look at is append to the responses and
7:25:49
easy way efficient to expend extra results. I want to see where we have different TV shows and things like that.
7:25:56
So I want to say we have different examples like that. Let me also check what our output was on here. So going to
7:26:02
table wise, we have Star Wars.
7:26:08
Is that the only thing that populated? I guess this is like one of the most
7:26:13
popular things over there. All right,
7:26:18
it's a pend to response.
7:26:26
This API reference can get better. Okay, so welcome to version three of the API. This is where
7:26:32
you find definitive list of currently available methods for our movie, TV, and actor image API. Honestly, I should have
7:26:38
gone this approach over here. I apologize. So, first thing that you'll notice over here, and I'm blurring out
7:26:45
my credentials over here. You can see we have get, we have over here, a post to
7:26:50
add a favorite, add to a watch list, we have get, favorite TVs that are get, we
7:26:55
have posts, get. So, it tells you what you need to set up over here, like add
7:27:01
in a movie, clear, create. You have a delete option also over here. Lots and
7:27:06
lots of really cool stuff we can play with. Obviously, I don't have unlimited time to walk you guys through every
7:27:12
single element of this API. Uh, but we can take a look at some of this stuff.
7:27:18
So, let's go look at TV seasons and we're going to go details and we'll see
7:27:23
what's going on over here. All right. So, it says TV series ID,
7:27:30
which we need to find a series ID, season, and season number. I'm going to try to grab Stranger Things because I'm excited to see the last episode tonight.
7:27:38
Obviously, my token is kind of blocked over here on the screen. Um, but yeah,
7:27:43
let's find that. So, create details of a TV season.
7:27:49
So, series ID, we have a response over here.
7:27:56
name. Okay. So, I believe this is the same barrier key that I populated. I
7:28:02
just want to see where these um series ID is located at.
7:28:08
That's what I want to figure out. We see we have the curl request here as well. Um so, I can just copy this curl
7:28:14
request, go in here, do another HTTP request,
7:28:21
import in curl. You can see it actually pastes in our bearer token as well. So
7:28:27
I'm going to actually delete this out, but the curl request will put that in there.
7:28:32
So be careful with that. CSPS or JSON, but now we just need to
7:28:39
figure out. Okay, so we have the season, season number, and series ID.
7:28:47
I want to find where the series ID is. So,
7:28:53
where can we find a series idea?
7:28:59
So, it it doesn't have a lot of stuff. Maybe
7:29:04
it's in the getting started side. So, we have a try it. We have our API
7:29:12
over here. Apologize for the dog barking.
7:29:20
We have a search as well. Let me just look this up. TMDB TMDB
7:29:26
series ID. All right. So, someone says, "How to get series ID?" I'm looking this up. There
7:29:33
are two ways when you via the website interface or via API. Okay. So, look, you can search directly in the API. This
7:29:41
is great. This is exactly what we want to see. So, I don't want to look on the website. I just want to go over here and
7:29:47
search this. So maybe make another HTTP request.
7:29:53
And uh this is a get.
7:30:00
I guess this is a little bit different. Ah, it doesn't matter. We can do a request or we can go on the website.
7:30:07
So it says that would be 4614. All right. Let's find Stranger Things.
7:30:17
Stranger Things and we're going to look in TV shows. All right. So, Stranger Things, we have
7:30:23
a ID of 66732. So, let's see if we can solve that. We'll go back over here. Don't need that
7:30:30
one. All right. So, we need to have a series ID.
7:30:36
Do we have to have the season number as well or that was optional? Let's go back over here and take a look.
7:30:43
Season number is required. Okay. So, let's put in five. That's what's going
7:30:50
on right now. This did not work because I actually didn't set up my authentication. Go back
7:30:56
to generic. Go back to header. And uh what we're going to do is grab
7:31:02
where's the movie one? Movie DB. All right. So, this return back our
7:31:08
data. And take a look. So what we have is the ID of that show, the air dates,
7:31:15
episode, the name, the network, which is interesting. Origin country is empty. I
7:31:21
would have just probably put that as US. Obviously, I don't have all this over here. Overview, ID, season number, vote,
7:31:28
average. A lot of other details associated with each of these. We have another episode
7:31:35
over here. all the crew and things like that
7:31:41
associated with it. A lot of data on that side of things. So now that's only
7:31:47
one thing over here for a season. Let's take a look at another thing we can find.
7:31:57
So let's go back to TV shows.
7:32:03
And where are we going to find TV?
7:32:08
We have lists and movies
7:32:14
trending TV. I guess we could do that as well. And then it says time window. So
7:32:20
this is interesting. This will be another request that we could do. It's a get request. So I still wanted to find I
7:32:26
think this is a pretty good one. I still want to find a TV series. Maybe the details. All right. So this will
7:32:32
actually give me more information. So, let's copy this one cuz we don't need the exact season. Maybe this will give
7:32:39
us all like the episodes. I think there's other ways though. I'm
7:32:44
trying to find a pageionation example.
7:32:49
Maybe it's this. I'm trying to get to us like where we can have multiple pages worth of episodes. And I know Stranger
7:32:55
Things might not be the best idea. We want to take a look at something a lot longer. Maybe like a cartoon show like a
7:33:01
Simpsons Family Guy South Park. But let's try this out. This might not be
7:33:07
the best over here, but we will try it.
7:33:15
This images list. What's list associated with it? List actually might be a better
7:33:20
one. Get the list at the Oh, this is going to be perfect because I feel like there's so many list. I really This has
7:33:28
pageionation. So, I chose this because I was hoping that would be the case. All
7:33:33
right. Um, we're series ID is 66732.
7:33:38
Hopefully, I'm not boring you guys to death as well. All right.
7:33:45
I think this is going to be perfect. Maybe not.
7:33:55
Okay, this probably is going to be a good example. So, we have a page over
7:34:00
here. Doesn't give us all of our examples. There's 105 total pages. So, we need to get into that next page. So,
7:34:08
we're going to have to do this through pageionation and uh we'll have to figure out how we
7:34:14
can build that out here in a second. So, we'll go into our ad option and then
7:34:20
we're going to go into pageionation and update a parameter in each request. So
7:34:27
we need to say response contains an externation
7:34:33
mode is off. There's a way we can get into here
7:34:40
a way to get to the second page. So I'm trying to figure this out really quick
7:34:47
because we can change a lot of different approaches over here.
7:34:54
I'm trying to figure that out in a second.
7:35:01
Should be documentation on how we could get there. So list
7:35:08
path prams. Okay. So query prams. You can see we change this now to two.
7:35:18
All right. We have a query pram where it changes. So
7:35:23
let's try that. We have this as page over here.
7:35:32
So page and then let's try page two. But it should be different because you can see this is page one. Let's see if that
7:35:40
works. The return response was identical 5x. So it stopped. check if pagionation
7:35:46
complete when um to specify that as well. All right, I'm
7:35:54
back. I took a quick break to figure out the pageionation. So, as you saw by default when we ran this over here
7:36:00
without any pageionation, one item, but we know that there's a lot
7:36:06
of other pages. You can see have one page, there's 105 total pages. So how
7:36:11
this was set up first I kind of went back and forth across the board. So what
7:36:17
we're doing for pageionation mode is update a parameter in each request we're doing a query and we're going with the name um page because we see over here
7:36:25
under query parameters there's something called page and it says by default it's one. So we have that. Okay. And then the
7:36:32
value over here if we want to update this we go to the body page plus one. So we want to get to page two we add one.
7:36:39
We add one more to get page three etc. So all we do is paste in this response.body.page
7:36:46
which we see if we execute step again. Oh sorry I meant to I should have pinned
7:36:52
this data. Let me pin this data. Both of these we're going to pin that data. I'm
7:36:57
going to pin this data because I'm tired of calling the API. All right. So the response.body.page.
7:37:03
So that's what we're grabbing over here. Okay. just use this one over here. Cool. So,
7:37:10
we have that. We're just gonna keep adding one. I know it says nan over here. It's just a weird quirk of
7:37:15
pageionation in N. Then I said pageionation complete when I typically use other. I build some type of
7:37:21
expression and I do response. Page is greater than or equal to response total
7:37:26
pages. So, obviously if this page is at 105, it's done. Um, so we can say that. And
7:37:34
we can also limit the amount of pages. So I don't want to have all these populate. So I only did 20 and I put max
7:37:40
pages over here as 20. And you can see I only have 20 pages that are getting populated for pageionation. Pagionation
7:37:47
is different on everything. And if you are still confused about pageionation as
7:37:52
well. Let me show you an example. I'm going to go to Amazon real quick.
7:38:00
All right. So I'm on Amazon and let's say I want to search for um I don't know. Let's go and search for a
7:38:09
gym piece of equipment. Let's say we want to get a new
7:38:15
it's like a weight sled. I don't know the official name. I want to get one of these eventually, but weight sled like
7:38:21
this. So, by default, Amazon is not going to show you everything. So, you'll see that we have this page over here
7:38:30
to another page which goes to page two. So essentially with our API, our API to save resources
7:38:37
does not want to show us everything. So it only shows us this one page with 20 items. Well, if you want to get more,
7:38:43
you have to use pageionation. And this one over here, I put 20 pages of 20
7:38:49
items. Some APIs allow you to change how many results are shown. Some will have like the next URL on this page.
7:38:56
Everything's going to be a little bit different on them. So to really hone in on pagionation, I highly recommend you check out my pagionation video because
7:39:02
both of those were completely different setups than this example. But hopefully that kind of makes sense on
7:39:08
pageionation. Like all we're trying to do is get more data. It's kind of a weird way to get data. Um it's going to
7:39:15
only give us partial data if we don't set this up. So we have to set up this. Typically there's some sort of expression. And by the way, this is
7:39:22
really one of the most complicated things in my personal opinion when working with GTP requests. You also have
7:39:27
other options over here too, which we didn't really cover too much in this video, but timeout might be a little bit
7:39:33
helpful. This is not pageionation, but just how long you want to try for an API before it times out. All right. Um,
7:39:40
let's go into a different direction now and just really quick show you an example of like a a post or not. Yeah,
7:39:48
let's do like a post or let's do a delete or something like that because we have all these examples. And there's
7:39:55
just so many. And uh yeah, we'll just grab one of these over here for example.
7:40:01
So we can add in a rating for a TV episode. And this is going to be a post.
7:40:06
So I don't think we've done post with the actual APIs as of yet. So what we're going to do is just copy in the scroll
7:40:13
and copy that over here. you see bottom left and all we need to do is series ID,
7:40:19
series number and it looks like there's another request section. So what's cool if I go over here importing curl it will
7:40:25
change this to post automatically as well. Obviously, I just blurred this so you don't see my key, but you can see we have posts. We have the URL. It says
7:40:33
series ID, season, and season number, episode, episode number, and then slash
7:40:40
rating. And then we're going to remove our authorization over here for my code.
7:40:45
And we're going to just going to say over here authentication generic
7:40:51
header to our API key. and it's movie DB and
7:40:57
then raw it says content type body and we'll have to fill this out here in a second. So let's take a look at that
7:41:05
example in the documentation says rate a TV episode save it to your rated list. So path parameters it's required to put
7:41:11
in uh series ID, series number and episode number. So going back to our
7:41:17
Stranger Things example, was this the Stranger Things or was it the next one? I think it was the next one.
7:41:24
Yeah, it's 66732 season 5. So, let's go here. We'll just write the first
7:41:30
episode. So, series ID. So, let's jump into this expression.
7:41:41
So, season number, series ID, and going back over here to add rating. Where do
7:41:47
we change this? TV. First thing we do is series ID. So, we'll put that over here.
7:41:54
Then it says slash season and it says slash season number
7:42:01
episode episode number. We'll just put one over here. So that's saved.
7:42:09
And then what says query parameters guest session ID and then session ID.
7:42:14
Not sure what the guest session ID is. um raw body this is required
7:42:22
and uh let's take a look at that here in a second.
7:42:29
All right. So going back into this. So we're going to have to send in
7:42:38
our JSON body I think. Let's double check.
7:42:44
A TV show. So, it rates the TV show and adds it to our rated list.
7:42:52
We have that. Okay. I wish there was. We have to send in a
7:42:57
raw body, but there's not an example of that body
7:43:05
header, which we have that over here. And you know what? Sometimes if you
7:43:11
don't know things, you can also ask. So
7:43:17
I'm gonna literally ask flaad. So I'll go over here and say based off this
7:43:24
documentation, can you give me the JSON based off this documentation?
7:43:33
You give me the JSON I need to rate.
7:43:41
I think that's what it's telling me to do is is send in JSON. It should be able to access over here.
7:43:48
That's all I have to do is value like that. Already have everything else. That is so
7:43:53
easy. We're just going to use value 8.5.
7:44:03
I guess all we have to do is put 7.5 here because I mean we can put the JSON here,
7:44:10
but let's try the 75 here. Otherwise, we're going to put in the JSON. Um
7:44:17
I don't know how I'd rate episode one. I think 75 is fine. Bad request undefined method each pair
7:44:24
for an instance of float. All right, let's try JSON.
7:44:31
using JSON. We're gonna try this.
7:44:37
It worked. So, all we had to do is change it up. Obviously, like I wish they sometimes in APIs they'll give you
7:44:43
an example. So, like you know says the response, we have the response over here. We don't actually have the example
7:44:49
of the role body JSON. Um, unless I'm missing it, but I just don't see it in
7:44:55
here. So don't be afraid to ask in a large language model like I did right over here or Google search. So and that
7:45:02
was an example of a post and I can see all requests over here too and should
7:45:08
have a request. I don't know why it's not in here yet but because it said it was a success. You can see status code
7:45:13
and success. So we did rate that over here. All right. What else can we do?
7:45:18
Delete rating. So let me just do the opposite now and we're going to delete a rating. So again, we could use a curl if
7:45:26
we want to or we could set this up by itself. Just copying this over here.
7:45:32
I'll go into a notes and we'll take a look at what this looks like.
7:45:37
So it looks like it's nearly identical. So
7:45:43
all we have to do is go over here and delete this time. So we're going to do
7:45:48
deletes series. And we don't send any any body.
7:45:56
See, it says defaults to zero. So, we don't need to send
7:46:02
this over here for the body. And I don't think we need to. Let's check our header parameters.
7:46:08
Headers content type defaults. Yeah, that should be fine. Yeah, I don't think we need to send the headers this
7:46:15
time either. So, we're just doing a delete. So, we're going to remove this rating that we've already set up and it should be fine. So, execute the step.
7:46:22
The item was deleted successfully. Awesome. Uh, I'm sure there's there has
7:46:27
to be a patch or a put also on here. Maybe not. Maybe you can't update it.
7:46:32
You have to delete it. Post get.
7:46:39
You know, I'm shocked that they don't have a put or patch. But either way, that is the movie DB. I mean, we just
7:46:46
touched the surface on it, and I really want you to explore it, but really what we did, we set up another API key. This
7:46:53
time, this API key was set as a header off this time instead of the query O.
7:46:58
So, I showed you how to set that up. We took a look at pageionation. We also
7:47:04
took a look at finding where these values are at. Sometimes you're going to have to search Google or look for other places. So, showed you that example.
7:47:11
Then we really went in depth into the pageionation side of things. So like if it doesn't give you all the examples,
7:47:17
how do you get more? Obviously pageionation is different for everything else. Then we covered a post where we
7:47:23
posted a rating to the website. Obviously we didn't see what the JSON body needed to be look like. So I
7:47:29
literally just asked our large language model to get what this is and it gave me that example based off the
7:47:35
documentation. And lastly, we did a delete which showed you um you know we could remove our specific rating. So
7:47:42
that is our API section for the HTTP request. Now we're going to have our NEN
7:47:48
workflow act like an API in the next section which is going to be for web hooks. Um it is going to be a little bit
7:47:55
more technical again and these are honestly some of the toughest sections and initially right between the HTTP
7:48:01
requests and web hooks but you're staying strong. Promise you the more and more you see this uh you'll get used to
7:48:08
it. And really using LMS helps you a ton. As you saw like didn't know what I
7:48:14
was doing in a small section. I asked an LLM and it helped me out. So use that as a resource. You don't have to know
7:48:20
everything. The internet exists for a reason. Stack Overflow exists for reason. So does large language models.
7:48:25
So use those to your unfair advantage. Awesome. And uh I will see you in web hooks now. So this section is going to
7:48:32
be very similar to the previous two. So last two sections we talked about APIs and how we could use any to get data
7:48:40
from some sort of external service and then uh we could also technically update
7:48:46
that data. We could delete that data. Uh we could send data outwards etc. Right?
7:48:52
And that was done through the HTTP request node and APIs. Well, what if we
7:48:58
wanted to have that external service be any end? So I'm going to be showing you guys how we could do that through web
7:49:04
hooks. And when inside any end, there's two things to know about web hooks. You have the web hook trigger as well as the
7:49:12
respond to web hook node. So essentially with our web hooks, what we have is an
7:49:18
an app outside of any end has some sort of action and then essentially because
7:49:23
of that action, a workflow starts directly in any. We use the same principles that we covered before. Our
7:49:31
get, our post, our put, patch, delete. Essentially, we just have our workflow
7:49:37
based around it. So, it's going to be pretty exciting stuff. Kind of like what I mentioned last time. I do have a full
7:49:43
in-depth web hook video with different examples. So, please watch that in
7:49:49
addition to this if you are confused a little bit. I understand web hooks will take a little bit to understand. So
7:49:55
let's jump into this and uh learn a little about web hooks. So before we jump into the actual node, I just want
7:50:02
to show you that any end does have native web hooks. The easiest example is going to be Google Sheets. So if you go
7:50:08
here and I'm just going to show you sheets and you'll see that we have three
7:50:13
triggers on row added, row updated or row added or updated. Well, when we make a change in Google Sheets, we can start
7:50:20
a specific workflow. And that's kind of one of the benefits of having this as a
7:50:25
trigger. In fact, any type of external app that has a trigger. Well, that is a web hook because we have an action and
7:50:32
another app. And because of that action, we want to have something happen directly in an end. Let's take a look at
7:50:39
a HubSpot example. So, we go to HubSpot and this is a CRM a lot of people use
7:50:44
and there's 18 different triggers. So, someone creates a company or deletes a company, we want to have a workflow in
7:50:49
any end. Uh same with the contact, same with a conversation or a deal created or a ticket created. So any of these type
7:50:55
of properties like we change something in HubSpot, we want to have a an end workflow start because of that. So if
7:51:01
you see like, hey, we're going to have a ticket created, you know, a customer has some sort of issue or we want to reach
7:51:07
out to a customer because we notice something on their account, this could start a full workflow. And obviously
7:51:12
there's settings for every single node internally like, hey, this is what we should do with this workflow and you'll
7:51:17
have to design it. But this is just the very basic level of a web hook. Uh just again think of it as a trigger in
7:51:23
external app. But what happens if the app that you want to use externally doesn't have anything natively in an
7:51:31
end? Well, you're going to have to set up a web hook. And let me just show you this over here. We can go to web hook
7:51:37
and we'll have two different nodes. So this is the trigger. And what we should do as well is say respond respond to web
7:51:45
hook. So you'll see that we have this over here and this is our node that we respond back and this is our web hook
7:51:51
that starts our workflow just like these over here this is not branded exact same
7:51:56
thing as the HTTP request if there's something natively in any end take advantage of it if there's not use the
7:52:02
HTTP request so you go into the web hook first thing you'll notice here at the top is you have two different URLs test
7:52:08
and production we'll cover that here in a second but just know there's a URL we have all of our HTTP methods delete get
7:52:15
patch post put. Then we jump into our path. So this is our URL. We can change
7:52:20
this if we want. So you can see I'm just typing in random stuff that changes. Then we have authentication. And this is
7:52:27
a very critical thing. So right now we're in test mode. We're not into production. However, if I published our
7:52:33
workflow over here and uh everything's ready to go, you're going to use our production URL for our web hook. And
7:52:40
there's two different URLs, right? You have the test one over here and you have the production. test has test in the
7:52:46
name. The the production is the same exact one without test and name. Why this specifically matters? Well, with
7:52:53
your production URL, anything online could access this URL if you are published. So, I could go out there on a
7:53:01
different browser in a different country and use this URL, the production URL if I'm live and access my N instance. Um,
7:53:10
the instance being this specific workflow. Again, why this matters is if you have sensitive data in this
7:53:15
workflow, if you have an AI agent or you have APIs that are going on that cost you money or cost you security, um this
7:53:24
is wide open in the web. So, that is a very scary thought. Now, the one way that we could handle this and actually
7:53:31
there's a lot of different ways we could handle this, some of them may be outside the scope of this video, is through authentication. So, you can see over
7:53:38
here we have basic off, header off, and JWT O. So as you saw in the last two
7:53:44
examples, we had an API key. So someone essentially had to have a specific password to access their API. Uh we can
7:53:51
set up these over here with the basic or eder. So that way not everyone online could access our uh workflows. In
7:53:59
addition, there's other things as well. So you can do an IP whitelist. You can allow origins over here, which I haven't
7:54:06
used this one before. I do believe it's a little bit new. I believe you can ignore bots, which is right over here.
7:54:11
And there's some other pretty cool things you can do as well on these options outside the video of course, but
7:54:17
you have to think about security a lot more when you're working with web hooks because anyone can essentially go into
7:54:22
your NAN workflow and especially if you have private info or anything that will cost money. So respond to web hook.
7:54:29
Sometimes when you're going to have an external service, they're going to kind of make sure that your web hook works
7:54:35
correctly. And let me just show you an example. monday.com has like a really great example of
7:54:42
responding to web hook. I actually covered this in a full video. If you want to learn a little bit more about it, I'd watch my Monday video. But we
7:54:49
essentially built this one out. So we would have a test web hook. It would go into any pass through this data and then
7:54:57
we would have to respond back and we would have to send back a challenge token. So monday.com wanted a challenge
7:55:03
token to confirm like, hey, you can actually handle this web hook. And once that challenge token was sent back, the
7:55:08
rest of the workflow could be built out. But because money.com doesn't have what's needed, that's why
7:55:14
we had to go and build this out. So you can see money.com and there is no triggers. So if you want
7:55:21
to have something happen based off of a board change, you're going to have to have a web hook. So while there's some
7:55:27
good stuff on here, it just didn't do the trick and we had to have that specific custom web hook built for it.
7:55:33
So, what I want to do really fast is show you how we could test web hooks.
7:55:39
And the easiest way to do this is through Postman. So, what we're going to do is test that
7:55:47
and then we're going to go and use a real application called Type Form. So,
7:55:52
first let's go into our web hook on Postman. So, I'm going to go over here, open browser, and I'm all I did really
7:56:00
quick is create a Postman account. Uh, so then when you get to your homepage
7:56:06
over here, I went into I believe is your workspace. So you can see my workspace
7:56:12
over here. So just to go back home, I went to workspaces. I clicked on my
7:56:17
workspace. And then you see where it says mock data generation. I just went over here for that. So very basic on
7:56:26
that side of things. And we're going to be testing directly in over here. and we're going to send information back
7:56:33
into nan. So, I'm just going to save this really fast. I'm going refresh it
7:56:38
because it looks like my instance is running and it's not. Um, and I should say instance my web hook node. So, what
7:56:45
I'm going to do is test with this test URL first. So, we're going to go over here and we're not even going to send
7:56:51
any information. We're just going to go over here. I'm going to go and say listen for test events and I'm going to
7:56:57
send information. So you can imagine this is an action in some sort of app and I'm going to go there and it says
7:57:03
this web hook is not registered for post request and you can see there's a mismatch because right now if I stop
7:57:08
listening this is a get whereas this over here is a post. So you want to make
7:57:13
sure that things are working properly. So let's change this up and put this into a post request. Let's imagine we're
7:57:20
creating some sort of data. So now this is a post and this is going to be a post. So if I listen for a test event,
7:57:27
it should work. And this is good to show you that we need to make sure things line up. And then it says workflow has
7:57:32
started. And then you can see over here our workflow started. We have our user agent which is from Postman. And again,
7:57:38
that's the website we're using for testing. We have no parameters. We have no queries. We have a body that was sent
7:57:44
over here. And then um which I don't know why we have Crystal Mills. That's
7:57:50
weird. Either way, um, or Chester, I don't know what that is. Um, either way,
7:57:56
we have this sent over and it is working. So, we can also send in some
7:58:03
stuff as well. So, we can name a key. Enter in a value and a description. So,
7:58:08
let's say we want to put over here a I don't know, we'll put a band and we'll
7:58:14
put in the value over here of north lane. And then we'll say we have a jam
7:58:20
band. And the jam band I was listening to today was, and I'll put this over here, jam band, widespread panic. So
7:58:28
we'll put widespread panic in here. Widespread panic. Cool. We're going to send both of
7:58:34
these values now into nan. So I'm going to just listen for a test event. Again,
7:58:39
we're going to send over this data. Said workflow was started. And then you
7:58:45
can see over here in our query we have a band north lane and then a jam band whites panic. So we can have an edit set
7:58:52
after this and we can extract these values. You can see exactly where these
7:58:58
are at. So you can see query band and query jam
7:59:03
band. And now we have these values. These values originally were over here
7:59:09
in Postman which again you can think of this as an external service. Doesn't necessarily need Postman. It's just for
7:59:14
testing and uh we sent this into any end through a web hook and now we have those
7:59:20
particular values and why I did post is we're obviously we're going to use this data over here
7:59:26
and we're going to create something out of it a little bit later. Maybe you want to do some like web scraping or whatever the case may be. But if you just want to
7:59:33
get a data set back um you would want to probably use like get. So try to use the exact things that you're used to like
7:59:40
get or post which is going to be web hooks probably like 95% of the time because I don't see like deleting data
7:59:46
that often within an end workflow and I don't really see you updating it. So no put or patch. Um post would be like
7:59:53
creating something and getting would be returning some sort of data that's automatically ready to go. Um this data
7:59:58
is obviously not ready to go. So I would probably just recommend most of the time you're going to set this to post
8:00:05
regardless. That's just a a very very basic demo. Uh we can set some sort of authorization though over here so
8:00:12
someone can't access it. So let's do that. We're going to go to authentication and let's set a header
8:00:18
off. And what we can do is set a specific credential as well if we want to. Um or we can do a basic O and set a
8:00:26
credential. So we can set a thing over here. And I'm just going to say web hook
8:00:32
long ne video. And you can set a username and a password for this one over here for the
8:00:38
basic o. So let's say we're going to say the username is um we're going to say
8:00:46
jam and then the password is strings like that. So
8:00:52
username jam password strings. I'm just going to make that as a note just in case I forget that.
8:00:59
to jam strings and we are taking a look at a basic O. So you can think of this
8:01:06
as a username and a password. So basic O like that. So now let's go
8:01:12
back over here and you'll notice that there's the authorization over here. So there's different options. So this is a
8:01:19
basic O over here. So if we try this without the basic O, we are going to get an error. So we can still try to send
8:01:26
the same values or we can change these values up. Uh let's change them up. We'll say currents. We'll say fish over
8:01:32
here. Both of those. And we'll try this again with this O. And you'll notice that this
8:01:39
is going to fail. So if I go over here, I say listen for test events. Again, we haven't set any authorization. And I'm
8:01:46
going to send this over. It says authorization data is missing. So we
8:01:51
need to actually set this up for this to work properly. And you can see it's still listening. Like obviously it did
8:01:57
not work. We're going to listen for test events. We're going to go over here. We're going to put our username as jam.
8:02:02
And then we're going to put strings. So strings like that. Now we're going to send it. Workflow has started because we
8:02:08
put the correct username and password. And now you can see we have currents and fish and our values over here are
8:02:16
currents and fish. So that is a basic way of authentication which is our basic
8:02:21
o. We go to header o it's even easier. So if I create over here and I say long ne video long ne any ne
8:02:30
and a value. So um we can put like I don't know it doesn't really matter on the side of things. We'll say n api and
8:02:39
then we'll say key1 123. So key one two three. We'll use any API and then we'll use key1 123. So that is saved. It says
8:02:49
yeah don't use key13. We'll go over here and say header off
8:02:56
header off n API key123. All right. So
8:03:04
have essentially our header off this time and I have n API and key12. So then
8:03:10
I go into Postman. I go to our API key. I set the value over here to N API and
8:03:16
then I set the value to key one two3. I specified that this is a header off. As
8:03:22
you can see, we have header off right here. That's our API key. We have the
8:03:27
value any API. Obviously, you can change these up as you want. And I just put key one, two, three. We can change up our
8:03:33
values that we want to send in over here, too. Um, so I'll put goose over
8:03:39
here. And then I'll put bear tooth. So, bear to like that. We'll send this over
8:03:45
here in a second. Once this is listening for test events, send that over and boom, there we go. We
8:03:52
have bear tooth and goose. Great in there. And uh it works. We have this
8:03:58
also weird body that we keep getting different names and things like that. Believe it's probably just testing
8:04:03
purposes. And you can see obviously we have this over here in our edit. So on the basic side of things, right? Once
8:04:10
again, you're going to have your two URLs. Test is when your workflow is not live. Production is when your workflow
8:04:17
is live. Then we have our different methods. You're going to probably use post or get only when you're creating
8:04:23
your own web hooks. Personally, I'd probably just keep it as post um because you're going to be doing something with
8:04:28
that specific data whereas get, you know, you're just going to grab that data. We can change our path, which is
8:04:34
going to change our URL. So, you can change this to whatever you want. You can set up authentication. So I showed
8:04:40
you basic O which is like a username password and then header O which is like our API key and then we can define those
8:04:48
down below over here. Give it to people only that have access. We have different ways to respond. You can respond
8:04:53
immediately or you can respond through that web hook node as I showed you with monday.com. They were asking for like
8:04:59
some sort of token. So essentially we need to send a token backwards to confirm their web hook works. And then
8:05:05
uh yeah, we have different options down here as well to block bots, which I'll just ignore this by default. And
8:05:11
obviously, I'm just testing. Another thing is like when you're testing stuff out and building it out, I wouldn't put your authentication right away. I would
8:05:17
just put your authentication at the very end. You should be pretty much fine if it's a test URL. As soon as you push it
8:05:24
into live production, you're going to have to move over some sort of authentication. Also, when you're
8:05:29
testing and if you're building out an app or anything like that, be very careful with your URLs over here. Once
8:05:34
you're good to go with your test and you're going to push things into production, just make sure you switch it out because your test URL is different
8:05:40
from your production URL as you can see. So, u be very careful on that side of things because I have seen people just
8:05:45
put their test URL and they're why is this not working and they should have been using their production URL when they're when their workflow was live.
8:05:52
So, that's the first part of this lesson. And the second part, we're going to actually go through a type form and
8:05:58
kind of set this up as an example. So, I just created literally a type form
8:06:04
account maybe 30 minutes ago right before recording this uh lesson. So, I'm just going to continue with Google and
8:06:11
I'm going to choose my account over here and uh we'll jump into it. So, all I did
8:06:16
is I I just created my account and I think I built like a very basic
8:06:23
uh form. I'm trying to even see where this is at. So, forms.
8:06:29
Yeah, here we go. my new form. I'll show you what it looks like. I think all I did is
8:06:35
just ask for people's information. First name, last name, phone number, email, company. This was like a default choice.
8:06:41
Obviously, you can choose whatever you want, but I just built out this form over here just to test it out. So, to go
8:06:49
backwards to forms, what I'm going to do is now click these three dots and I'm going to go over I want to say it's
8:06:55
either connect or something like that or workflow. And I just started this. So we're gonna
8:07:01
say connect. Okay. So it is connect. And what we're going to do is take a look at web hooks. And it says trigger web
8:07:08
hooks. Not familiar with web hooks? Just ask your tech team for a hand. Well, I am your tech team on the side of things.
8:07:13
We're going to figure this out together. So I am going to say add a web hook. And it says find an endpoint. We'll send
8:07:20
your web hook to this URL. So we're going to use our example. Well, let's add in a new web hook. So we'll say web
8:07:26
hook over here. We'll put this as post
8:07:31
and we'll grab this over here. Okay. So, I'm just going to copy this and I don't
8:07:38
think it mentions anything if it needs to be a post or a get.
8:07:44
Let's just click to learn about web hooks to see if it mentions.
8:07:52
Look, here we go. Type form web hooks are sent with a HTTP post request in the request body. It's in JSON format.
8:07:58
Perfect. So, I was right when I said post. So, grab our web hook. Make sure that you are in post. And then we're
8:08:06
going to say save web hook over here. And you'll notice that we have our web hook. Great. So, I think we're in the
8:08:12
77. I'm going to listen for test events. And we're going to go over here and we're going to say view deliveries. No
8:08:19
deliveries. Send test request. And now we sent a test request with our form. So
8:08:25
first name, last name, phone number, email, uh, short text, and then thank
8:08:31
you screen. So now what you'll see over here is we have this directly in over.
8:08:36
And obviously like the properties are empty. So like you can see title, property, it's empty, empty, empty like
8:08:42
no one's filled this out, but we now have this information directly in here. And again, like always, we can just go
8:08:50
and do an edit set and clean up our data and we can just grab specifically what
8:08:55
we want. So like obviously over here, we don't really have our exact names and
8:09:01
things like that, but you could imagine uh if this side was filled out. Okay, this is someone's first name. This is
8:09:08
someone's Well, actually going back over here, I take back what I said. I think when they have like this title, I think
8:09:15
that's exactly the example they give us. I could be wrong. Short text, title,
8:09:22
company. Yeah. So, I want to say
8:09:29
we've went through an exact copy. This would be the data we give us. Could be wrong. Like obviously I could test this
8:09:37
and send some other data. I'm not live. But either way, it's going
8:09:43
to be one of these over here. Like whether it's like a type idle properties, it's probably this title if you're going to push this into
8:09:49
production. We're not testing this in production wise, but you get the point. I can just go over here, grab what
8:09:55
people actually are filling out, and make these fields and then do whatever I want with it later on. And I would
8:10:01
recommend just renaming these, which is why we're using our edit set. You could say like first name
8:10:08
that and then I already duplicated that twice and then last name. Again, feel
8:10:14
free to change up as you want. And uh yeah, that is type form.
8:10:19
I also, by the way, I covered web hooks in another video too. If you know a little bit about Python programming, we
8:10:24
have a streamllet video. Uh we're going to cover streamlet when we talk about you user interfaces for applications as
8:10:30
well. But essentially in streamllet I created a payload that got sent to a nan
8:10:36
web hook and it was working. So that was type form. I just wanted to show you
8:10:41
like there's going to be documentation about it. No matter where you find your web hooks, this was our documentation.
8:10:47
It was super easy sent via HTTP post request. You saw we just went over here, found a way to test it. All websites
8:10:54
will have some sort of way to test your web hooks. Just make sure it comes in over here. see what the data looks like
8:11:01
and I would also test it with real data as well beyond that but uh you know testing is half the battle and when
8:11:06
you're ready to go make sure that you push this into production and you use the production URL so that is it for web
8:11:15
hooks be safe with them don't have a workflow that's live without any type of security with your web hooks I would
8:11:22
also recommend in the future too with your web hooks like you can really expand this out you can add an if node
8:11:28
codes and stuff like that to make sure the data is correct. Make sure they're correct people are accessing your web
8:11:34
hooks. Like there's a lot of other ways that you could secure outside of just this basic and header off. So, um, spend
8:11:41
some time if you really worry about the security. This is just a brief introduction. And yeah, that is
8:11:47
essentially it for this section. Next section we're going to be taking a look at, I'm just going to look over at my sheet,
8:11:54
is going to be web scraping. So, this is going to be really fun because we're actually going to grab data online in
8:11:59
some capacity. So, we'll be taking a look at how we can scrape social media sites, scrape websites, and uh blog
8:12:06
posts, and you guys are going to be have a blast for that section. So, I will see you there. Great work so far. So, this
8:12:12
section is going to be pretty fun because we're going to dive into web scraping. Now, historically, web scraping has been difficult. You have to
8:12:19
write a lot of code in Python and you have to hope that a website does not change because if it changes your code,
8:12:26
it's outdated and you're going to have to rewrite sections of it. Tedious process. Um, a lot of people struggle
8:12:32
with it and there was a ton of freelance jobs out there just to build scrapers to check on competitor sites. The landscape
8:12:39
of scraping has changed a ton over the last few years and we're going to be covering revolutionary tools like
8:12:45
Firecrawl that make web scraping super simple. Um, other things we're going to cover in this is going to be uh Appify.
8:12:52
So, I use Appify for social media scraping. We're going to use Rapid API as well. I'll show you an example of a
8:12:58
workflow that I just built with it. And then we're going to also talk about RSS. And now RSS technically isn't scraping.
8:13:05
It's going to get us the latest articles that a website will populate. Um, but I wanted to throw it in over here because
8:13:12
some people might just want that information and might go a much more complicated route. So, let's take a look
8:13:17
at that now. All right. So, this isn't technically web scraping, but we're going to start with it, and it's going
8:13:23
to be RSS. And what RSS essentially allows us to do is stay up to date with
8:13:29
different websites. So, often websites are going to be posting blog posts. And you might want to read these or put them
8:13:37
in a newsletter or whatever the case may be. You want to say up to date. And there's two different nodes that allow
8:13:44
you to do this. So if you have a middle of a workflow and you want to read a website, we have this RSS read. However,
8:13:52
you can actually start a actual workflow with RSS trigger. So the RSS feed
8:13:58
trigger monitors a website and when there's a new post, we can actually start a full workflow based around it,
8:14:06
which is pretty awesome. Whereas this RSS read, we have something else that starts the workflow and then it
8:14:12
eventually goes into this RSS read. The one tricky thing with RSS is actually
8:14:18
finding RSS URL. So sometimes going to take a little bit of research. Where I
8:14:24
find RSS URLs, I'll just Google search or I'll use Perplexity or a large language model and say, "Hey, this is a
8:14:31
website I want to find information about. Do you happen to know what the RSS link is?" because it's not always
8:14:38
obvious. So for example, I searched AI RSS and I came on this GitHub that this
8:14:46
person created a repository over here and you can see it says all AI news sources a list of online news and info
8:14:52
about AI, ML, big data and their websites. This is an extract of all the sources aggregated on all AI news
8:14:57
website defunct in 7204 update. You can find a live web page from the source below at and uh there's a media site. I
8:15:04
don't even know if it's actually accurate or not. Let's take a look. So, we have all this over here. A giant
8:15:12
feed of data, but if we go in here, you can see we have all of this. All this tons and
8:15:20
tons, which is pretty cool. And you can see there's some with YouTube over here.
8:15:25
And actually, I'm curious if I could be added in here.
8:15:31
Probably definitely not in over here. Not that it matters. I don't know a lot
8:15:37
of people are searching through this, but you can see YouTube channels have RSS feeds. And we'll just grab uh one
8:15:44
over here. Remember when I was studying for first aid analyst job, I was watching Alex the analyst. He's grown a
8:15:51
huge following. So imagine if I get RSS feed from there. Again, we'll just populate this and execute step. And you
8:15:58
can see his latest videos. So you have a title, a link, publish date, author, the
8:16:04
ID, and then ISO date. Uh, so you can see all this information over here. What does a data analyst do? Meetings, data,
8:16:11
Excel, SQL, day in life of a data analyst, meetings, SQL, so much food. It's a lot of day in life videos it
8:16:17
seems like right now. Data analyst salary in 2025, 50K to 75K. So that's on
8:16:24
like the YouTube side. Going to go there. Um, we can go to websites as well. So, in podcasts. So, let's take a
8:16:30
look at a podcast. For example, we'll grab something over here called the machine learning podcast. Well, let's
8:16:36
actually grab a different one. Let's go fireside. The artist of data science.
8:16:42
Grab this. Never heard of this podcast. It's probably pretty good. And uh we'll just grab RSS. So, we'll duplicate this.
8:16:49
I'm just going to right click and over here, duplicate. And what we'll do is paste that in.
8:16:58
This actually did not work. No big deal. We'll grab another one. AI in business
8:17:04
podcasts. Let's see if that one works. And URLs can change and things like
8:17:10
that, too. So, not a big deal. And you can see this one brought 168 results
8:17:17
back over here. Why post merger integrations fail without data governance. I agree. Um, data governance
8:17:23
is something that I was exposed to at my current job. I had no idea it existed and it's actually pretty important. It's
8:17:29
boring, but it's important. Um, so that's a podcast example and uh just go over here and copy again.
8:17:37
Let's find a website this time. So that's a podcast. Oh, where there I see TensorFlow.
8:17:44
That would be a good one. TensorFlow blog. Perfect. So let's grab that
8:17:53
and we'll use that as an example. Cool. So, and what's nice too is with RSS
8:18:00
feeds, they're already sorted. Like there's a sort node in any N, but and I'll show you the sort node as well. I
8:18:06
think we've covered that in the beginning, but if not, you can go over here and do sort. You can sort to change
8:18:12
the item order, a simple random code. Again, I'm I'm like 95% sure we covered
8:18:18
this already. But regardless, YouTube, podcast, and website, we just
8:18:24
covered all that over here. Typically, what ends up happening is I find that people stack these together. So, like
8:18:31
imagine you had three right here. And then ideally, what you want to do afterwards is have edit sets. So, we'll
8:18:39
do like edit set over here. And people often just make sure that the name is
8:18:45
going to be the same for each of these and then there's like some sort of merge. So like go through here
8:18:53
and then we'll have a merge associated with it. So because typically I want to
8:18:59
get all these together and I see the merge like this not being too that
8:19:05
often. So maybe we'll do like a merge of three. Play all these over here. I'll just show you this in a second. Okay, so
8:19:11
we have this going on. Oh, the other thing, let's limit these. So, we're
8:19:17
going to do a limits and let's say we just want to limit each of these to like a three.
8:19:24
And it could be up to you how many you want to limit, but I do see this happening.
8:19:30
So, set those across over here. I'm going to keep whatever is default. It says one. I'm just going to keep that
8:19:37
default because I really don't want to change all these. add these in here. So, next what we want to do is and I guess
8:19:43
we're building out a workflow for RSS. Didn't really plan on doing that, but that's okay. So, we have one YouTube
8:19:50
over here. We have a podcast and there me zoom out. So, what we're going to do
8:19:57
is execute the previous step.
8:20:02
All right. And we'll do like oh no, title and link for each of these. Title, link, and pub date. We'll just keep that
8:20:08
the same. So, just make sure we have those. Execute previous node.
8:20:16
Title link update. That's easy. That's the same there. Is it going to be the same
8:20:23
on this one? Sometimes I've seen it differently. I guess they're all same on this one.
8:20:30
Maybe it was just like a one-off that I had before. That was a little bit different. know, like most of this is like the
8:20:35
same, like 95%. Either way, we have all these. Now, if I run this
8:20:42
workflow, we're going to have three items.
8:20:48
And uh you'll see we have a title, link, and pub date across the board. And we
8:20:54
just got one from YouTube, one from a podcast. And you know what we could also do too? I thought of one more idea.
8:21:01
Let's call this platform platform like this and we can hardcode
8:21:06
something in. So this is YouTube and we'll do the same for the other
8:21:12
ones. I think I misspelled YouTube but the monitor is like right down here and I want to stress my neck out. So we'll
8:21:18
do platforms. This is podcast. And then lastly
8:21:24
we'll say platforms and this is website blog. So we'll say web blog. Cool.
8:21:31
run this all again and uh yeah that's essentially RSS
8:21:38
pretty basic you can see platforms my nice spelling YouTube podcast and my blog
8:21:44
very simple so if you want to monitor stuff you have that option for you so in addition there's the trigger so let's
8:21:51
imagine I'm a huge fan of Alex analyst YouTube channel and I want to just
8:21:57
monitor his channel and say like hey anytime he uploads a new video. I want to get alerted. So that's what a trigger
8:22:04
would allow you to do. You can put in the feed URL over here and then you pull to see like, hey, is there new content?
8:22:10
I would just do this like every day. Set a specific time. If you know someone uploads in the morning, maybe do this in
8:22:16
the afternoon. Doesn't really matter. You can fetch a test and when he when this polls and it notices that there's a
8:22:22
new piece of content, it starts the workflow and you can see what does a data analyst do? Meetings, data, Excel,
8:22:28
SQL. And honestly, I might build out an RSS feed trigger for my YouTube own
8:22:33
YouTube channel uh and really automate some social media posts. So, still on the fence how I want to build this out
8:22:39
yet, but this is one of the triggers I'm thinking about for utilizing that workflow. Either way, that is RSS. I
8:22:46
know it's not technically web scraping. It does get us web content. So, I wanted to throw this in here as that first
8:22:52
example because I think it's pretty impactful. The next is going to be a service. Uh, and we're going to be
8:22:58
setting this up and it's called Appify and I love Appify. So, I've used it for
8:23:05
customers and I think it's phenomenal because it allows us to scrape social
8:23:10
media super super easy and yeah, now it is expensive. I'm not going to sugarcoat
8:23:17
that. So, if I go to app.com, I think it's $39 a month. So you can see
8:23:23
pricing and it's $39 a month. And essentially what this allows us to do is
8:23:29
to buy scrapers on the website and we can have $39 worth of scraping credit.
8:23:35
So people or ampify build out scrapers and then you could utilize them. So why this is really helpful, let's imagine
8:23:41
you want to scrape Instagram accounts or you want to scrape Tik Tok accounts or whatever the case may be, there's
8:23:46
probably a scraper on Apify that you could use. And what it really allows us
8:23:51
to do is to kind of expand out our data. So imagine, and it's probably easier to
8:23:59
demonstrate over here, we have some sort of a CRM system and we have influencers in our CRM, but we just we aren't
8:24:06
tracking how many followers that they have. Well, we can scrape for that. And I just want to give you guys like a a a
8:24:12
quick example of something that I built for a customer. And essentially what I do
8:24:21
is, and I'll just only grab partial part of this workflow. All right. So, this is one of the scrapers that I use for a
8:24:28
customer of mine. And under their social media roster, they have different YouTubers and they just want to track
8:24:35
like how is the YouTube channel progressing over time. Is it getting more subscribers? Are they linking to
8:24:40
our service on their YouTube channel? And you can see over here it says
8:24:46
crafted by streamers but it's maintained by ampify. You can also see on this side
8:24:52
of things as well um how you can run it. So there's a form or you can run JSON. I
8:24:57
would recommend that you build this out in nan. And I'll just show you a quick workflow that I built out. And uh I'm
8:25:04
just going to remove some of the sensitive information so you don't see that. But this is one of the different scrapers. So we can post in YouTube
8:25:11
channels and we get a lot of information. You can see in the information side of things, you know, what YouTube channel can I extract with
8:25:17
this tool. You get the channel name, number of subscribers, which is great if you want to monitor it. URL, the channel
8:25:23
description, so if you're targeting specific things, the location, uh video titles, video URL, date of posting,
8:25:30
thumbnail URLs, total view count, and links in video description. So a lot of data, and there's a lot of different use
8:25:36
cases for this specific stuff. It says how to use for YouTube channels, keeping track of competitors channels, etc. Like
8:25:42
there's quite a bit of information. I'll show you how to use this here in a second in nan. But yeah, so let me also
8:25:49
show you really fast essentially how I built this out. And this unfortunately
8:25:54
will not be in the final product of, you know, JSON that I give you guys. So this
8:26:01
is going to be deleted out over here. But this is an example of a customer
8:26:06
workflow. So there's also a manual trigger associated with this and I'm just going to kind of walk you through
8:26:12
how this is built out. So ideally in this workflow what happens is there's a
8:26:17
schedule trigger and a manual trigger. We have a metabase query that's already
8:26:23
been built out. Now metabase is essentially a a BI layer and it's usually used for like reporting
8:26:29
purposes. And essentially what I did is I built out a question metabase where we
8:26:35
just want to have specific influencers where we want to track. So there's some information on there like what's their
8:26:40
Instagram account, what's their YouTube account, um, and what is I'm trying to think of the other platform. Oh, Tik
8:26:45
Tok. So that's the three platforms we're tracking. All I do over here is clean up this data because I have different
8:26:52
branches. One for YouTube, one for Tik Tok, one for Instagram. And I I filter out anyone that doesn't have that
8:26:57
particular account because every influencer won't have a YouTube channel. every influencer won't have a Tik Tok or Instagram. Then what I do is I aggregate
8:27:05
all the influencer URLs and I send them to an actor. So when you're using Amplify, you're going to want to use
8:27:11
this run an actor and get a data set. We're actually going to cover this node here in a minute. Then I'm just going to
8:27:17
merge everything back together. So this merges uh the following account back into that specific ID. We edit the
8:27:25
fields. we populate it just based off of how HubSpot wants their data and it gets sent to HubSpot. Um, this code also
8:27:32
allows us to look through URLs and make sure that service is actually linked on their profile. Do the same thing as well
8:27:39
over here for Instagram. One of these is an Instagram scraper and one of these is a Tik Tok scraper. Again, all we do
8:27:45
essentially is we have a list of influencers which we have specific filters based around uh let's say
8:27:51
revenue that is being brought in. Then we filter if they have that specific accounts or not. Then we aggregate all
8:27:58
those influencers together just to populate this specific node. And just to kind of show you over here, we go into
8:28:07
input. You can see in the JSON, we can use multiple URLs. So since it cost 30
8:28:13
cents every time to run, it's best to optimize it and run for all these channels at once or profiles or whatever
8:28:20
the case is. So that's why we have this built in. uh merges it back. As I told you,
8:28:25
sometimes you'll want to have merges just because it's easier to work with the data. And then we just clean up
8:28:31
everything here at the very end and uh populate that into HubSpot. So, pretty easy. Let me show you amplify now as a
8:28:38
particular node. So, I'm going to go into amplify
8:28:44
and you'll see that there's a lot of different things in over here. Honestly, the one that I use 99% of the time is
8:28:51
run an actor and get data set. So, essentially what this allows us to do and I'll just zoom in over here
8:28:59
is run the run the actor which each of these are considered an actor and then
8:29:05
at the very end it gives us the results like how many followers, how many posts and things like that. So, it runs the
8:29:10
actor and then gets that back. So if you think about this in terms of like an HTTP request, this is essentially the
8:29:18
the post like our post runs the actor runs the actor and then get we get the
8:29:26
data back. And in in the past you would actually have to use an HTTP request, multiple
8:29:32
HTTP requests to get this working. But since this is a node and any and community node, you're gonna have to go
8:29:39
through this route now. It's much easier. All right. And then we just jump into this node. So essentially what we do is create a account. So this is my
8:29:46
personal account over here. All you have to do is set in an API key. I'll show you where you can get your API key here
8:29:52
in a second. Choose a resource. I'm using an actor on that side of things. Operation run actor. Get a data set. You
8:29:58
can use recently used actors or you can go to ampify store actors. Uh you can grab an actor from a list by URL or ID.
8:30:07
So you can see an example URL over here. and then example ID of an actor. This
8:30:12
input JSON, all I do is if you see for example, you see how we have this JSON there. All I do is copy in this JSON.
8:30:20
So, copy then paste it directly in on that side of things. And it's it's
8:30:25
literally just as easy as that, right? Uh to get your API key, let me go and
8:30:32
show you. We go to API. We go to API endpoints. And then essentially what we do and you can see it says the URLs
8:30:39
below contain your API token. Don't share them with this. And essentially
8:30:44
when you click on this I and I'm not going to do it here. It's going to give you a token which is your API key. All
8:30:50
you have to do is paste that directly into
8:30:56
our account. So you see this API key? Whatever this is over here that's hidden. That's all you have to post.
8:31:02
It's so easy. Use the Appify node, label it, paste in your key like that, and you
8:31:11
are good to go. I just want to quickly see if I can share. Yeah, I can share really quick one of these examples of
8:31:17
what the JSON looks like for an actor. So, in this case,
8:31:23
all I did for this input JSON is I have this over here, and it's obviously an expression. So, usernames and I have
8:31:31
JSON profile, Instagram, and I just map these out. I had to clean up a little bit of the data. I got a little bit of
8:31:37
help with cloud code on this side of things, but that is an example of an Instagram scraper. I just used that. Um,
8:31:45
if I go into another one, this is an example for
8:31:50
what? This is YouTube. So, let me grab this show you what this looks like. So, if we go to YouTube this time, you can
8:31:57
see I say max result streams, max result, max shorts. Like, I don't care about this stuff. All I cared about is
8:32:02
the YouTube channel. So, I just grabbed our YouTube channel a little bit earlier and I specified those specific URLs. And
8:32:09
then Instagram or sorry, Tik Tok is the last one over here.
8:32:15
And it's going to be slightly different for every single actor that you use. And you can see over here, exclude pin post.
8:32:21
We have the profiles, results per page, um, downloads, things like that as well. So, very straightforward. That is how I
8:32:30
essentially do this with Appify. It's phenomenal because you can literally just go in over here, you can find an an
8:32:36
actor. So, you go to the Appify store, you search for something that you want. You can see Tik Tok is here at the very
8:32:42
top, Facebook posts, tweets. So, if you're trying to grab something from social media, I would probably re and
8:32:49
you have the budget because it is $39 a month, I would just recommend that you go over here and utilize it. You can see
8:32:56
my usage for this month is is $10 and I only have $5 my account. So, I'm already over and I believe it gives you like $5
8:33:03
by default. So, I technically can't run this right now and I'm not going to put it on my customer billing. So, for I'm
8:33:10
not going to show you that in the video and that's why I showed you a specific workflow. But, it's really easy. It's just one node. You can set things up and
8:33:17
get going. What I am going to show you and we're going to build this together or actually I'm going to kind of walk
8:33:22
through this with you guys is rapid API. So I'm going to load this up on my
8:33:29
second screen and I'm going to show you what I built out. All right. So
8:33:36
another service that there are tons of APIs and it might work out for you is
8:33:42
rapid API. So it doesn't have a native node in nan. So you can see if I just
8:33:48
search rapid, it's not going to be in here. So you can see that's not the case. So we're going to have to actually
8:33:53
set up an API call. And let me just put a note over here and say rapid API
8:34:01
and go rapid API. And we're going to have to do an HTTP request. So HTTP
8:34:07
request like this. Pretty straight. So, what's really cool about Rapid API
8:34:14
is it's actually quite cheaper than Appify. Although, you know, depending on what scraper you want, Appify may have a
8:34:21
better scraper. Rapid API might have the scraper for a specific use case. Uh, each person charges whatever they want
8:34:27
for their scrapers. So, one of the examples I recently built out is a
8:34:32
workflow to get all of the YouTube transcripts from my YouTube channel because I wanted to start adding in
8:34:38
timestamps because I know it's good for YouTube SEO. So, I found this scraper over here. It says YouTube captions,
8:34:43
transcripts, subtitles, video combiner, and they have different costs associated with it. So, you can see out of the box
8:34:49
like it's $0 and you get 100 requests. Now, I'm paying this pro for 5,000. I'm
8:34:55
going to pay for it once. I'm essentially going to get all the videos that I want and then I'm going to go back into this basic for free because I
8:35:01
don't upload more than 100 videos. So, I'm not doing transcripts for other people. Uh you can see there's obviously
8:35:07
a rate limit of a,000 requests per hour. Not going to pass that off. And uh yeah, so we're pretty good on this side of
8:35:13
things initially because I have like three 400 videos need to use pro and then jump back into basic. But you can
8:35:20
see who the creator was if you want to take a look at their information. It says sign up to contact provider if you
8:35:25
have any specific questions. Um, and you can also, you know, test endpoints and things like that. So, I'll show you how
8:35:31
we set this up and I'm actually going to give you guys this full workflow. I'll put it in over here since I couldn't
8:35:37
share that last one minus just showing like I don't want to give away something I built for a customer. However, I am
8:35:44
happy to provide the one over here. So, I'm just going to pause the video really quick. I'm going to grab it. Just make
8:35:49
sure I don't have an API key that is being shared and then we will kind of explore it. All right. So, I loaded in
8:35:56
this workflow. I'm going to walk you through all of it. If I went node by node, this would take too long. And uh
8:36:03
next section has a pretty long and thorough example. So, there is going to
8:36:08
be one node in here that you guys aren't familiar with, which is loop over items. We're going to talk about that a little
8:36:14
bit later on in the course, but I felt like this was a good area um to kind of present everything else. So, what we're
8:36:20
doing is taking a spreadsheet of videos as well as URLs. So, these are different
8:36:26
videos on my YouTube channel that don't have any timestamps on them. So, you can see title and video.
8:36:34
And essentially, I'm generating the description as as well as the time stamp. I'm filtering out anything over
8:36:39
here that has um a non-time stamp. So, I'm looking for it to be empty. Then
8:36:45
what I do is I start looping over all of these. I believe I loop one or two at a time. I do a batch size of one. And the
8:36:51
reason why is I'm getting rate limited. Again, we'll cover this when we talk about the loop over items node a little
8:36:56
bit later. Next thing I'm doing is I'm transforming the URL. So, you see how this has a video URL. Ideally, I just
8:37:03
want to have this section because that's in the API documents. So it says only to pass in this video ID. So this over here
8:37:11
just strips it out and gets me the video ID and uh then I use my HTTP request. So
8:37:19
I just follow the documentation that is based around over here. So it gives me
8:37:25
examples and then I did a curl request as well. So you can see the endpoint says download all and then you paste in
8:37:32
that video ID which you can see download all and then I paste in that video ID. Let me close that out and close that
8:37:40
out. So we already know where the endpoint is. So just grab that
8:37:45
and then I have to send specific query parameters and they talk about some examples over here.
8:37:51
You can see all the different stuff you can grab. I believe when I was building this out
8:37:56
initially, I just did a test endpoint. I would show this to you guys, but it is going to leak my API key and I generally
8:38:04
don't want to have that leaked in this video. So, I'm not logged in on purpose.
8:38:09
And uh all I did when I was testing it is importing the curl. You just have to build in this endpoint. Um, also
8:38:17
obviously like you are going to get this workflow. So you'll have availability to just paste in your API key right here
8:38:25
and test this out. So there's two sides of it. There's the description as well as the timestamp. This will get me the
8:38:31
all the subtitles for the video and the captions or whatever you want to call it. Now we need to build out a
8:38:37
description. I am going to actually parts of this description as well. And I
8:38:43
don't want to be super mean, but I spent a lot of time to try to build out a really great prompt on the side of things and some of the examples I don't
8:38:49
want to share, but you can see you're a YouTube description agent. The best video descriptions have average of 250
8:38:55
words. They should include the keyword of the video and you include your keywords early in the first 70 characters. So, I'll keep that. But you
8:39:01
can see I have quite extensive one. All we're doing is passing in the subtitles as the prompt and then we essentially
8:39:07
get our description which will be over here. The second one is the timestamps. So, I just go over here. You are a
8:39:13
timestamp creator. A user uploads subtitles with time. You need to review all of them. Suggest a number of timestamps based on the video. Again,
8:39:20
it's a pretty thorough prompt. I won't be sharing all of it, but I will give you a good amount to start with. And I would recommend you tweak it for your
8:39:26
own specific use case. So, we have that over there. Again, I just go to edit fields. One of the things I found is we
8:39:33
need to get our initial like video URL and things like that. You can see the
8:39:38
URL in this loop over items before it passes over here just to get that string. So I just do a merge later on to
8:39:46
get that exact YouTube video URL. Now we have all three things. We can actually match on this YouTube URL. And based off
8:39:54
this match, we add in the description as well as the timestamp. So that is a
8:40:00
little bit more of a complicated build. Like I obviously explained this in what like five minutes or so, but this took
8:40:05
me a lot longer, especially with building out a good description, building out good timestamps. So we go
8:40:13
from this Google sheet, we filter out everything, we loop just because I was
8:40:18
hitting rate limits over here just based off of the amount of text. So we loop over these. We extract just
8:40:26
the video ID. We go to an HTTP request which we set up going through over here.
8:40:33
There's also discussions. Um so if you ever see errors, you can take a look at that and um really go through the
8:40:39
documentation on that side of things. First build a description, then we build
8:40:45
out the timestamps. Could you build out both at the same time? Sure. But I feel like in this opinion, the time stamp and
8:40:52
the description are different. So I I just let each of them be generated on their own. Just clean this up a little
8:40:59
bit. You can see I just reabeled this as timestamps. I reabeled this as description. Merge everything together
8:41:06
including the initial YouTube URL. And then you can see over here I map everything. So you can see video used to
8:41:13
match is this JSON.video. The title I'm not doing anything with. We're keeping that the same. I use the
8:41:19
description, use the timestamps, and then once that's done, it goes back over here and loops over the next one. And
8:41:24
you can see like I have hundreds of videos. All these are just going to get populated over here. I'm not going to
8:41:29
run it again because it was expensive to run. And uh they have been mostly added to our YouTube videos. This one's going
8:41:36
to be an expensive one to run as well. It's it's going to be a long video. So that is Rapid API. And again, you can
8:41:43
just take a look at their platform and see what's available out there. people build out a lot of different APIs and
8:41:49
you can see there's MCP for APIs, there's top categories. So, tons and
8:41:55
tons of stuff. This is a little bit more complicated than Appify. Like Appify is basic to set up one node.
8:42:03
I just show you here. Whereas Rapid API, you're going to have a bunch of different HTTP requests depending on the API service that you use. Uh different
8:42:10
pricing as well for every single API. Uh let's just take a look at this one over here. So, real time LinkedIn. I'm not
8:42:17
going to set this up, but I'm curious what the cost is. See what subscription
8:42:22
plans this API provides.
8:42:27
I guess it's
8:42:32
it's interesting. Yeah, maybe have to have like a rapid API plan. The one I was paying on was just pay for results.
8:42:39
And there's probably a filter for that, too. Let me go back to homepage.
8:42:46
I'm sure you could filter by that as well if you really wanted to. Um, but there's so many APIs. YouTube API, real
8:42:53
time, Amazon data. So, start on one of these sites before you want to
8:42:58
specifically write Python code to scrape because like chances are you're going to get blocked
8:43:04
in some capacity and unless it's like really customer niche site, chances are it's going to be either in Rapid API or
8:43:11
apply. I wish I could give you guys a little bit more details. I just don't want to leak my API key here and be
8:43:17
honest, I'm out of spend and I don't want to spend another $40 to get this video going. All right, we're going to
8:43:23
cover one more which is going to be fire crawl. So firecrawl is pretty amazing. I
8:43:28
was initially going to do an example over here, but in the next video we're going to be going through a pretty
8:43:34
extensive example of firecrawl. But let me show you. It's a node over here and
8:43:39
you can see a check mark maintained by firecol. So um and it says a new node package is available as well. So I might
8:43:46
as well update this. This is a community node. So I'm going to update this over here. I'm going to confirm that update
8:43:52
and confirm update.
8:43:57
Cool. So package has been updated and we're just going to load firecrawl in over here and we're going to take a look at some of the different options that
8:44:04
are available. So first what we have is search and optionally scrape search results. So I use this one frequently
8:44:12
and the reason why I want to use this one specifically is in Google maybe I
8:44:17
want to get the top five or top 10 results and get those URLs. So when I
8:44:22
want to do research for a brand I'll want to do this. So you can search whatever query that you want and you'll
8:44:28
get those specific results. So, we can test this out on anything like we want.
8:44:35
Um, let's go and search I don't know.
8:44:40
All right. So, let's go and search cheese steaks
8:44:45
in Philly. We'll execute this step. And you'll see
8:44:51
we have these different URLs associated with it. Um, so we have the URL, the title, the description, and the
8:44:56
position. Obviously, I only did five over here. You can expand this out as well. And we have a guide to Philly
8:45:02
cheese stakes, Reddit talking about ranking 14 tasting table, this other one, top 20, and then visit Philly
8:45:09
talking about Philly cheese stakes. So really cool that we can get our search results. And there's a lot of different services that you could do this as well.
8:45:16
It's like SER API, the same exact thing where you could go and get the Google results. So next is mapping a website
8:45:22
and getting all the URLs. So essentially, if you want to see what URLs are available on a site, this can
8:45:27
get expensive if you have a very large site. I believe there's limits over here as well. So you can limit like there's
8:45:32
5,000 URLs over here. But if you go to a large e-commerce site like a Best Buy or something like that, they might have 20,
8:45:39
30, 40,000 different items available. So this works with smaller businesses. When you get pretty large or even extensive
8:45:45
blogs, might not be the best approach to take. You can see scrape a URL and get its content. So you can literally just
8:45:52
paste in a URL over here and it scrapes all the information on that side of it.
8:45:57
Then you have crawling a website. So you can go over here and search for specific information I believe with crawling
8:46:04
sites. Then you have batch scrape for multiple URLs. So we have the one URL or
8:46:10
you can go multiple over here. There's batch scrape status. So essentially like a little bit more advanced side is
8:46:16
polling. So if you're scraping a lot of things, maybe you want to see if it's ready or not, if there's any errors, you
8:46:22
have that as well. You could have specific crawls going on, preview crawls, cancel a crawl job. So like a
8:46:29
lot of different options on that side of things, but really where Fire crawl is helpful at is two things. Number one or
8:46:36
three things. Number one, grabbing Google search results. So if you want to get additional data, Google search
8:46:42
results and you can send this data elsewhere. Number two, it's really great at going on to a website so you can find
8:46:49
all the URLs that you specifically want and scrape a specific URL or just researching what is on that site.
8:46:55
Firecrawl is really awesome on that side. I think things also their icon really pops in any and we'll jump
8:47:01
through a a bit of an example in the next video. I initially was going to do it in this video, but I actually
8:47:08
recorded uh section 16 before 15 and I ended up making a 50-minute video uh on
8:47:14
a workflow where we build it out from scratch and use this firecross. So, don't fret if you're confused and I kind
8:47:19
of flew through it, but yeah, we're going to do this in greater detail. So, just to kind of cover scraping in any
8:47:26
end, right, we have the first one over here, which is RSS, which can get new blog posts. It can get new YouTube
8:47:32
videos, new podcasts. So you can either set this as a trigger to start a workflow or you can grab a source and
8:47:37
take a look at the x amount of their last uploads. Then if you want social media, you have two different options on
8:47:44
that side of things. You have ampify which is super easy to set up. Throw in an API key. Just grab your actor. Uh
8:47:50
obviously you have to set the JSON which sometimes can be a little challenging if you have a lot of things you want to search but honestly it's really easy. It
8:47:57
is expensive. And then you have ampifi or not appi but a rapid API down below.
8:48:03
Rapid API is a little bit more custom. Had different pricing plans specifically based off of the scraper that you want.
8:48:10
There's a ton of different options on there. I'm paying individually for a scraper like $3 a month as I showed you
8:48:16
guys. And this was an example of a workflow which you guys can download and start using. Lastly, what we have over
8:48:21
here is firecrawl. So firecrawl helps you on an individual website. So if you
8:48:26
want to grab data from an e-commerce website that typically would block a Python scraper, uh Firecol is great for
8:48:33
it. In addition, if you want to grab search results. So that's why I didn't really show like a SER API because Firecol already has this built in. And
8:48:40
personally, I'd rather just pay for one service rather than multiple. But you have those options because I know I
8:48:46
don't believe we've talked about ChatHub yet, but Firecall is not available in ChatHub yet whereas the other one SER
8:48:51
API is. But I could see that changing over time. So that is web scraping here
8:48:57
in nan and uh I know this was a little bit different than some of the other
8:49:02
sections of the course. Hopefully you guys still learned a lot and just remember you can you can play with this
8:49:08
whole workflow. It'll be available to download and yeah that's the link over here to that specific scraper. A lot of
8:49:15
your time scraping is honestly today just searching to see if the scraper exists and it still works or is in the past you would really write a lot of
8:49:22
Python code. So, up next, we're going to be diving a lot deeper into AI agents
8:49:29
and really going into what makes good prompts. And we're going to learn a lot more about this system
8:49:35
message as well as what the user message is over here. I just realized also you guys don't know a little bit about that,
8:49:41
but next video you're going to learn a lot more. Maybe I should have switched these initially, but too late now. See
8:49:48
you in section 16. And uh great work. Now, it's time for us to really jump
8:49:54
into the nuances of AI agents. So far, throughout this course, we've done some very basic, simple prompts, but
8:50:01
realistically in the real world, that's not going to be the case. You're going to have some advanced AI agents, and you
8:50:08
know, a lot of the principles of designing workflows with AI agents, they're going to matter. So, I need to
8:50:14
teach you all this essentially now that we have a lot of the basics and understandings of how like any N works.
8:50:20
Um, also to note, this isn't going to cover everything. There's other AI nodes which we'll talk about a little bit
8:50:25
later. There's other AI settings and things like that which we'll be sprinkling through some of these other
8:50:31
lectures. I do expect this one to be pretty long and, you know, there might be a few things that trip up people. But
8:50:38
if it does trip you up, rewatch it and it should click. Also, we're going to probably do two or three different
8:50:43
examples at the end. So, um, don't worry about that side of it. we just uh try to
8:50:48
reiterate what we've learned. All right, let's uh jump into NEN and yeah, so
8:50:54
let's start this off. And I just have a bunch of notes on my second screen, so I'm going to reference those. But first
8:51:00
thing is we're going to grab our AI agent. So we'll go over here and we'll
8:51:06
take a look at this. And really we'll we'll dissect each of these sections. Let's do a quick recap of what we've
8:51:13
learned so far with an AI agent. So, so far, and again, I haven't been super explicit. There's two ways that you
8:51:19
could work with an AI agent. Well, there's been more than two. The first one is with a chat trigger. So, you can
8:51:25
see it says connected chat node. So, we go from the chat node into our AI agent.
8:51:30
And you can see there's no option for us to set a prompt because what we have directly in here is the prompt. But
8:51:37
whatever we put in over here in this chat message, it gets sent to our AI agent and then some sort of action is
8:51:44
taken. Well, there's the other side of it is like that's not always the case. You could have an AI agent in the middle
8:51:50
of a workflow. So just duplicating this, all you have to do if it's in the middle of a workflow, you go over here and you
8:51:56
define below. And you can see it says prompt user message and you could type in your prompt over here. So when
8:52:03
someone talks about a user prompt, they're either talking about something that gets sent from, for example, a chat
8:52:09
message or something that is defined directly in over here. This isn't the
8:52:15
only type of prompt that you'll be using. So I want to teach you something that is called the system prompt. And
8:52:24
why the system prompt matters? Well, the system prompt does not change. It's
8:52:29
static. Whereas the user prompt will change every time. So, let me just write this out so it's a little bit more
8:52:34
explicit. User prompt equal changes every time.
8:52:43
System prompt. You can change this occasionally
8:52:52
to get better results.
8:52:57
And let me show you where we could access this. So, first if we go into our AI agent and we bring this over here,
8:53:06
you have to go into your options settings and then you'll see it has a system message and it all it says over
8:53:13
here is you are a helpful assistant. Well, that is not helpful. In fact,
8:53:18
there is a full guideline on how you actually want to set up prompts for your
8:53:24
system message versus your user message. And in reality, what you need to do is you need to spend more time on your
8:53:31
system prompt. So I'd say like spend 80% of your time
8:53:37
on your system message. And this is why because even a great
8:53:43
system message can help with poor user prompts. Sometimes you're going to be building
8:53:48
out programs and you cannot control what someone is going to enter in. And we'll
8:53:54
learn about this a little bit in ChatHub, which is our next lecture. But you're not always going to be able to control what someone puts into a
8:54:00
program. And what's expected is you write a phenomenal system message that
8:54:06
explains like what is going on and let someone put their user message over
8:54:12
here. So this is one of the most basic fundamentals is like getting your system
8:54:18
prompt correct and also your user message. And again, we'll cover this a
8:54:23
little bit more in detail shortly, but super super important. So, like what are
8:54:29
examples of things that you would want to put in your system prompt? Well, you know what
8:54:35
the biggest example is and really really helps is multiple examples. So, a good
8:54:44
prompt is going to give examples. And in the AI space, this is going to be called
8:54:50
something called fewot prompts. So zero shot prompts, they give no examples. And
8:54:56
zero shot prompts can work, but they're not the best. Then you have a oneshot
8:55:02
prompt, which is one example. Then you have something called a fewot prompts, which is two or more examples. So, if we
8:55:11
go here and do something like very basic. Let's say we're creating a translator AI agent. And let's just call
8:55:18
this over here translator AI agent. And let's say we just want to
8:55:26
translate um I don't know, let's think of English to Spanish, right? As basic
8:55:32
as it is. So, instead of writing here, first you are a helpful assistant, let's get rid of that junk. And we're going to
8:55:38
say you are an AI agent that solely I'm
8:55:43
probably misspelled solely. So that I'm just going to write here an agent that translates
8:55:50
messages from English to Spanish. And I don't know Spanish. I
8:55:57
just know it's the second most spoken language here in Florida. But I'll just put this over here. And I felt like this
8:56:03
would be a good example for you guys. So up first we defined in our system message like what is the purpose of this
8:56:12
AI agent and I know we're talking about few shot examples but first thing first
8:56:18
you need to describe to the AI agent what it actually does then what we
8:56:23
should do and doesn't necessarily need to be next but here are some examples we'll define something like that here
8:56:30
are examples we say user and let's say Hello
8:56:36
AI example user AI
8:56:41
user AI. So we can do three different examples over there. We can say welcome
8:56:50
to AI agents and then
8:56:55
thanks for subscribing. And all I'm gonna do because I do not
8:57:00
know Spanish, I'm gonna load up Claude really quick. And I'm just gonna ask, and this is gonna be an example of a
8:57:08
bling this out. We're going to just say,
8:57:16
check this out. Your name in Spanish Danish, please fill
8:57:21
out.
8:57:27
All right. So, I'm just asking it to fill up this AI section over here. This is fine. This would be super easy.
8:57:36
All right. I did know. Hola.
8:57:45
Okay. And lastly, boom. So, we have all three over here
8:57:50
now. And obviously, we could we could change this up if we really wanted to. Uh, but
8:57:56
regardless, I think we could actually expand this. It' be kind of interesting. We'll we'll cover it here in a second.
8:58:02
But we have these over here. Let's keep this very basic. And then what we're going to say is user.
8:58:09
And then what we're going to do is pass in some information. So, let's actually build this one out. Again, there's way
8:58:16
more principles of building out effective system user prompts, but we're just going to start very basic. Also,
8:58:22
I'm going to just add in a chat model. I'm going to go over here, add an open AI
8:58:28
should do. Okay. And we're going to go to GPT5 mini.
8:58:34
All right. So, GPT5 mini.
8:58:40
What we're going to do as well, we actually don't need to define that since we're just going to have this over
8:58:46
here. And whatever we write now is going to be translated. As you can see, we
8:58:52
have this chat input over here. And I'll still show you the other way how we could do this. Um, and let me actually
8:58:58
define this translator AI agent chat.
8:59:04
So, we're actually do another one in a second. Cool. So, let's open this chat and then let's write something else. I'm
8:59:12
going to write free ne templates
8:59:19
school group. I don't know if this will translate correctly or not, but you know what?
8:59:25
Let's give it a shot. So, it's going to go over here and we're giving it the user message free any templates to my
8:59:32
school group. And then uh we go. I'm not going to even try to pronounce it. It's
8:59:38
a little bit in my way because the microphone right over here. though I could technically see the output and hopefully that it's the correct way. But
8:59:44
you can see because we have this system message over here that explicitly
8:59:50
defines what this AI agent needs to do. We already know our example.
8:59:56
Let's uh expand this out a little bit more. And I want to just make this a little bit more interesting. So I want
9:00:04
to do a manual trigger one. And we're going to actually pass in a few things this time around. So, what I
9:00:11
want to do is let someone choose what language that they want to translate in into. And what I'm going to do is go
9:00:18
into edit set. And we're going to put in over here,
9:00:24
let's say translation string. Translation
9:00:31
string. And then we'll put over here language.
9:00:36
Okay, I misspelled that
9:00:49
and we're going to put language. All right. So, for the translation string, I'm going to say free and end templates
9:00:55
in my school group. We're still going to put this over here. And then for language, I'm going to put Hindi because
9:01:01
I know a lot of people in India watch the YouTube channel. So, I'll put that over there. All right. And then we're
9:01:06
going to use our translator AI agent over here. And uh going to change this
9:01:12
up slightly. So this time what we're going to do is we're going to define our prompt below. And what we're going to
9:01:20
say on here is actually let me run this here first. So we have this pinned for
9:01:27
testing. Cool. We're going to go in here and we're going to define our stuff. So, I'm going to just put an expression or
9:01:34
make this full screen. We're going to put a a translated string and then we're going to put a message. So, now I need
9:01:40
to think this through and we'll say message
9:01:45
to translate and then we're going to say language.
9:01:52
Cool. And now, so you can see we have message to translate and then language. So what I'm
9:01:59
doing is essentially building this out where people can choose different languages to translate. So now I need to update our system message. So I'm going
9:02:06
to say you're an agent that translate messages from English to another language.
9:02:12
Here are some examples and
9:02:17
we're going to say is message to translate instead of user. Then we're going to say language
9:02:27
Spanish. And then it's going to go through there. So
9:02:32
we will just rewrite these really fast. Honestly, I should just expand this out.
9:02:39
Okay, cool. And uh just fix these out.
9:02:46
So we're going to see my message translate. Thanks for subscribing.
9:02:52
crates. Yeah. So, we have our message to
9:03:00
translate here first and all we need to do is define that our language
9:03:08
there and then we just have the example what the AI responds back with. So, let's try that out and uh see what
9:03:14
happens. And this is just an example of it being in the middle of a workflow. But what's really cool is I can just change this edit set and let's say I put
9:03:21
Chinese over here or I put Spanish or I put whatever else. It it doesn't really matter or Portuguese. This AI agent will
9:03:27
automatically translate it. And uh I have no idea if this is correct or not.
9:03:33
So what I'm going to say is Hindi to English and we're going to put that over here
9:03:40
and see N templates in my school group. There we go. So, we can change this now. And
9:03:47
let's say over here instead of Hindi, what's another language? We'll put
9:03:53
Portuguese. I think that's how I spell it. No, it's obviously not because I misspelled it.
9:03:58
Let's go over here and spell it. Here we go. Don't uh butcher me too much in the comments. We'll put Portuguese here.
9:04:05
Great. And then we'll run this. And uh it says this over here. So we're going
9:04:10
to say Portuguese, English, and prian templates in my school group.
9:04:17
So very basic on that side of things. However, we can expand this out even
9:04:24
further. So one of the things that's in N that I think is really really helpful
9:04:30
and this is even outside. um it's been around for a very long time and also
9:04:35
we're going to say this is transa agent not chat but yeah
9:04:42
so one of the things that's really powerful is you can actually define how we want our output and we can structure
9:04:48
that with JSON which is really cool because now we force our AI agent to
9:04:55
specify an output and why that's important is we can have extra nodes later on in the workflow and we could
9:05:02
essentially take our results from the AI agent and then perform more uh actions based around it. So let's say you need
9:05:08
to have a specific format for a CRM or you want to send specific data into an
9:05:15
API of some sort. We can format it directly over here. And let me show you how we could do that as well. So I'm
9:05:22
just going to go over here and call this a version two. And I guess this is fine.
9:05:28
And I'm gonna click in and I'm gonna go and choose over here require a specific
9:05:33
output format which is really cool. So it says connect an output parser in the canvas to specify the format that you
9:05:40
require. So what we can do is go over here and choose an output parser. Now
9:05:46
the one I like using is the structured output parser. And you'll see this is an example that they give us. So, they say
9:05:53
state, California, cities, LA, San Francisco, as well as San Diego. You
9:05:58
also can choose a JSON schema like this, but I'll be honest, I use this probably about 95% of the time. So, I'm not going
9:06:05
to bother changing this up. Um, feel free to use the schema if you wanted to, but I kind of just prefer this approach.
9:06:12
So thinking about this now, the translator AI agent, you know, maybe I want the final output to say, hey, this
9:06:19
is uh English before and then after different language. So we can do
9:06:26
something like that. Let's go over here and say new language.
9:06:33
I'm going to put over here as Spanish.
9:06:39
And then what I want to do as well is say translations
9:06:45
and we'll put one of these examples over here. And we're going to also want to modify
9:06:52
this as well. So show you really fast. All right. So
9:06:58
actually what we're going to do is row this in like this. All right. Let me make this full screen. This can be
9:07:04
easier. Cool. So, we're going to say language.
9:07:11
This I want it to print out Spanish for the language.
9:07:17
We'll have message to translate and then translate a message. I don't need that anymore. So, I'm going to remove that.
9:07:27
Then, we're going to say message to translate,
9:07:33
thanks for subscribing. And then we're gonna say
9:07:38
translated message.
9:07:45
Cool. So now when we look at this, we'll have that
9:07:51
there. There's one error. And it's kind of weird. Your first time using it, but with JSON, just don't put a comma here at the end. So comma there. I'm also
9:07:59
just going to format this so this looks way better. So we say language Spanish message to translate and then translated
9:08:05
message. So that's exactly how we want our output to look like. I already kind of defined it over here. We could
9:08:10
obviously tweak our system message and maybe if we have a little bit more time we do that, but uh screw it. Let's see
9:08:17
what happens. We go over here. We'll run it.
9:08:24
We'll see what happens. We I think we're on the Portuguese one still. So we'll
9:08:29
see. Okay. So you can see language Portuguese message to translate and then it has the
9:08:36
translation right over there and it's it's really cool. So you can see that in the schema our output is like that. And
9:08:42
what's nice now and so we have an edit set after this is why I'm saying this is really
9:08:48
great. You can see can just grab all this
9:08:57
right. We can grab this wherever we want. Very, very basic. Um, obviously I
9:09:03
just showed you edit set. There's a lot of other nodes out there that we could work with. However, I I just shown you
9:09:08
really fast like drag and drop. We have all this formatted rather we're over here. Obviously, we just had our single
9:09:15
output with the results. Uh now we kind of have it broken down and we don't have the option of like uh our AI agent
9:09:21
saying here is the translated response because sometimes you'll get some extra stuff in there like here's the
9:09:27
translated response from English to Spanish. And really like all we cared about is like what language was it? What
9:09:32
message? What translated message? And we did all that through a structured output
9:09:38
parser. Uh which we have that right over there. Really cool. Uh, again, there's a
9:09:43
lot of sections into the prompt. So, we're just going to keep adding on in that side of things, but I just wanted
9:09:49
to show you another quick win when it comes to specifically
9:09:55
building out AI agents. So, we're going to keep going forward. I'm actually going to delete some of this other
9:10:00
stuff, and I just don't want to bore you guys with all the prompting fundamentals. So, another thing that's
9:10:07
really cool is you can actually enable a fallback model. And I think we already touched on this a little bit in the course, but you know what happens if
9:10:14
Open AI is down? We can add in a second model. So you want to change these up and just in case you have like Anthropic
9:10:20
over here. Uh so Open AI is down, you have Anthropic as a backup or vice
9:10:26
versa. Like choose your first model that you want in this first position, then have a second one over here just in
9:10:33
case. Especially in production builds, you'll want to do this. I know we'll talk about it a little bit more also
9:10:38
when we have pair handling and things like that but topic for another day. So
9:10:45
in reality you can have up to five different things this AI agent right you could have fallback models you can also
9:10:52
have memory and we'll talk about memory here in a second because you'll want to use this with the chat trigger but you
9:10:58
have memory now then let's say you have an a specific tool and tools are really
9:11:04
cool because what they allow you to do is attach some type of service into your
9:11:09
AI agent and you can see there's a lot of different tools we can scroll down all the way. So, you can add in like the
9:11:16
Google suite or you can add in other things like that. And, you know, I think we're going to have probably a section just talking about tools with AI agents.
9:11:22
Maybe we'll put it here. I don't know. Um, we'll see how long this specific lecture goes. And then you have your AI
9:11:28
agent. So, let me just add in a a generic tool. And you can see if we go
9:11:33
and uh put Gmail as a tool. So, you can see it's Gmail and it use the same
9:11:39
credentials that you had a little bit earlier. You can see we have five uh different things attaching to our
9:11:45
particular AI agent. In fact, I do think we're probably going to talk about tools. I'll put that on my list. I
9:11:50
didn't know if I was going to put in this video or another one, but we'll put this over here in a second. Okay. So, we
9:11:56
talked about the system prompt and user prompts. That's good. There talked about
9:12:01
structured outputs. Let's also talk about some of the limitations associated with these AI agents and and large
9:12:08
language models themselves. So, one of the things that's kind of a drawback that most people don't realize, a lot of
9:12:15
these AI agents are trained on old data. So, let me explain what is going on over
9:12:21
here. And I'm just going to load up Sonnet 45 and uh we'll grab this. So,
9:12:29
it's probably in the press release, but let's take a look at what it says.
9:12:38
We're going to look for um a knowledge cut off date.
9:12:46
And I guess we don't see that. Let me look up another one.
9:12:53
Okay. So, here we go from Anthropic Transparency
9:13:00
Hub. And they have different types of models over here. And I didn't expect us to
9:13:06
talk about different model um options as well right now, but we're going to cover
9:13:11
a little bit. The first thing I want to look for is your knowledge cutoff dates
9:13:16
on here because this will tell us its memory. So if we're using Opus, it says
9:13:22
cloud opus 45 has knowledge cutoff date of May 2025. This means the model of knowledge is most extensive on reliable
9:13:28
information and events up to May 2025. Why this is important? If you ask a question out of the box to the LM
9:13:37
without any tools, without any other additional API or services or anything like that and you ask a question of
9:13:44
something like I don't know, right now we have all the different college football bowl games going on in the
9:13:49
playoffs. So if you ask like what happened in a bowl game recently, it's not going to have that information. It just wasn't trained on that data because
9:13:56
it's May 2025. And this is different for all models. If you go to sonnet, which is one of the models I use all the time
9:14:02
and it's cheaper than opus and it still gets pretty good results. So if you take a look at the knowledge, you can see
9:14:10
January 2025 and there's ways to cut around it and we'll we'll talk about
9:14:17
perplexity open AAI responses. There's another tool called Tavly. I haven't used it as of yet, but you need to find
9:14:24
a way to to essentially supplement knowledge if you know the process that
9:14:30
your AI agent is going to be used through needs up-to-date information. Hopefully that makes sense. So to kind
9:14:35
of reiterate it, your AI agent needs to access real-time information or near real-time information. Something that
9:14:41
happened a month ago, two months ago, three months ago, you need to supplement your AI agent with either a a tool or b
9:14:48
with like another API. For example, OpenAI has a responses API. We'll be covering that here in this video. Um,
9:14:54
responses allows us to get newer information, but it's just super important that you do that. Um,
9:14:59
tool-wise, you could use perplexity or tablet. Otherwise, you're going to be missing information and what happens
9:15:05
sometimes is our AI agent will hallucinate and think of an answer which is not correct. So, really important.
9:15:12
Okay. The next thing I wanted to talk about really fast is like choosing a model
9:15:17
and kind of part of it is understanding what models are used for. Like Opus is a
9:15:24
very expensive model. It's really good for deep research, but you're going to
9:15:29
pay for it. So if budget does not matter to you, maybe you want to use Opus. However, if you're a little bit more
9:15:35
budget friendly and you still want something that performs pretty good and you might want to use Claude Sonnet 45
9:15:42
and these numbers are just based off of the updates. So, for example, GPT started with GPT 5, then there's GPT
9:15:48
5.1, then there's GPT 52. So, larger updates uh will continue to happen. I'm
9:15:53
sure at some point there will be a GPT 53, 54, 55, and then it'll update. There's a massive overhaul. It'll go to
9:16:00
the next number. So, like this is halfway between Sonnet 4 and Sonnet 5.
9:16:05
Maybe not exactly halfway, but um on here you can see also the release date, but I want to go and also take a look at
9:16:12
some of the pricing. So, I'm just going to take a look at that and explain how this is working. So, Sonnet 45 pricing
9:16:20
and uh hopefully we have it on this side of it.
9:16:27
Nope, that is not on this one. Okay, let's
9:16:33
see if it's in this one. So, we're going to say pricing.
9:16:39
All right, so it says Opus 45 is available. We're just going to use the Opus for pricing over here. Pricing is
9:16:45
now five and then also 25 million tokens and uh Cloud Developer Platform actually
9:16:51
might have our full pricing list. I don't know why I didn't think about that, but let's take a look at our API
9:16:58
pricing. Sweet. Okay, so
9:17:04
if you want to start really learning about like what models you want to use, I would recommend start taking a look at
9:17:10
the exact API pages that Claude has, that Gemini has, that OpenAI has because
9:17:16
it's going to really tell you some stuff. So, for example, what you have over here is your input, and it says $5
9:17:23
per million tokens. Now, what does that mean? Well, this is your prompt that
9:17:29
you're sending to uh clot. So, if we go back into our deeper AI agents, we go
9:17:35
into this example over here. We're sending our prompt and our system
9:17:42
message over, right? And these are going to count as tokens that count up to your
9:17:48
million. And you're getting charged $5 per million tokens. Our output is $25
9:17:53
per million tokens. So that is our response, right? This is our output over here. So we're getting charged $25 per 1
9:18:00
million if we're using opus over here. Now why I like using I use a lot of
9:18:06
short prompts. I don't believe in large prompts and we're going to talk about that in uh this lecture as well. But you
9:18:12
can see if prompts are under 200 tokens, you're getting charged $3 per million tokens. If it's over, you're getting
9:18:18
charged $6 per million tokens. Um, and then the output over here for prompts under 200k tokens, you're paying $15.
9:18:26
Otherwise, you're paying $22. So, you can see, um, if you have larger outputs
9:18:32
and things like that based off of prompts, maybe you want to start using Opus, um, because it can get quite
9:18:37
pricey, right? $6 per million which is more expensive than here and you're paying $2250 comparison to $25. You also
9:18:44
have prompt caching pricing based off of write and read. Going to not cover that here but regardless your input is what
9:18:52
is being sent to the model. Your output is those particular results. You can see over here most intelligent model for
9:18:57
building agents and coding. Sonnet has optimal balance of intelligence costs and speed. And then haiku says fastest
9:19:04
most costefficient model. So, if you're looking for something that's just super costefficient and very cheap, you can
9:19:10
see it's $1 per million and then $5 per million on that output. And it doesn't even mention uh input and output. One
9:19:17
other thing to note, and I want to I want to really cover this over here as
9:19:23
well. Each of these models have a different limitations with what you're
9:19:28
going to be sending as your input. Uh, so whether you're using like a Gemini or
9:19:33
OpenAI or whatever that you use, if you will have to send a lot of texts, which
9:19:39
again I don't recommend, take a look at the documentation because you might be getting cut off in some sort of
9:19:44
capacity. Um, I can also load up Gemini prices or OpenAI API prices. So let me
9:19:51
look this up so we can have that. Okay, so here is pricing for Open AI.
9:19:58
So, I use GPT5 Mini a lot and you can see the input price is quite cheap. 0.25
9:20:04
per million tokens. Output is $2 per 1 million tokens. So, if you guys ever wonder why I use GPT5 Mini in a lot of
9:20:11
YouTube videos, um here the price like it is significantly cheaper. Uh which is
9:20:18
why like I don't always use Sonet 45. I think Sonic 45 is way better model and results and great for coding but um this
9:20:25
is quite cheap and when we're really doing demos and things like that rather save the money when I can. Uh you can
9:20:31
see GPT 52 the best model for coding at Gentic Task and Industries even 52
9:20:36
inputs 1.75 so already input is cheaper and the output's $14 and output is like
9:20:43
$15 here. So um 52 is still cheaper than sonnet 45. So I am spinning a lot
9:20:50
sometimes in videos when I use this but you know it is what it is right. Uh you
9:20:55
have also fine-tuning models over here and then you can see other additional information over here. We're going to
9:21:01
talk about image generation a little bit later. This is the responses API. So it says our newest API combining simplicity
9:21:07
of chat completions with the built-in tools of assistance. We're going to be using this a little bit later in the video. There's built-in tools over here
9:21:15
as well. Uh this is going to be used in our rag section and uh yeah there's
9:21:20
there's quite a bit and also what model should I use? We recommend the developers use our large and mini GPT
9:21:25
models for everyday tasks. Our large GPT models generally perform better on a wide range of tasks while our mini models are fast and expensive for
9:21:31
simpler tasks. So, one of the things that's pretty cool to do is when you're building out your workflows and you're
9:21:38
testing, see if you have a big result difference between using a cheaper model
9:21:44
and a larger model. Sometimes it does not matter. So, if you're really looking for cost savings, what you'll want to do
9:21:51
is first test with a cheaper model, then test with a larger model or more expensive model, and just see what the
9:21:57
results are. Um, I find sometimes that the cheaper models work perfectly and
9:22:02
sometimes you need to change your model for something that's a little bit better with coding or something else. Again, we
9:22:09
have this option to go over here and you can always set fallback models as well. Uh, another thing to briefly mention and
9:22:16
man, there's there's just so much. One of the things that people do is stuff way too many tasks, way too much context
9:22:24
into an AI agent. And that's just an issue. What I like to
9:22:31
personally do, and I'll just write this out for you guys, is one task per agent.
9:22:38
Now, this doesn't mean exactly one task for agent, but don't ask your agent to
9:22:43
do a million tasks because what some people want to do is like, hey, I want you to, I don't know, extract this
9:22:50
information. Then, I want you to summarize it, and then I want you to build out a social media post all at once. And it's like, man, you're st
9:22:56
you're confusing your agent. You're giving it too many tasks. So, I try to break down these to like one simple task
9:23:03
at a time. If it's like a supplementary task that you think it could do both at the same time, sure, try it. But really
9:23:10
focus on one task per agent and you can chain things together. So if you go to
9:23:15
agents, you can always send the output of one agent into another agent. And
9:23:20
guess how we have officially done that? Well, if you go back to your structured output parser,
9:23:27
look, we already have our specific stuff. And we could literally just let
9:23:32
me just pin this data. I don't know what I'm going to do with this here in a second, but we go over
9:23:38
here, you know, we can send our output over here directly in to our prompts,
9:23:47
right? Because we have these expressions.
9:23:53
I'm going to say Laura Misfit as I didn't really think about this when I was prep prepping this video, but you
9:24:00
can see we can send the results from the previous AI agent into this agent. So, it's not unheard of for sometimes you
9:24:07
have like two or three A agents together in a row. Again, super important. I'd
9:24:14
focus on like one task per agent and limit your context because
9:24:20
although these agents will say you can upload one million context and tokens
9:24:26
and let me show you why I say that. Gemini context window and that's what it's
9:24:31
called as well. And uh
9:24:38
where is this at?
9:24:43
All right, let's see if this is on here. It's like there's a lot of stuff over here. Let's look for context window.
9:24:51
Yeah, 1 million tokens, which means up to 1500 pages of text or 30k lines of
9:24:56
code. Like that is a ton. However, there's research papers and let me find you this research paper lost in the
9:25:03
context. I think it's called loss in the context or it's like needle and hay stack. I can't remember the exact paper
9:25:09
name. But what ends up happening if you stuff too much information into your AI
9:25:15
agent like too many tasks or too much text things are get are going to get forgotten and you're going to have to
9:25:21
deal with something that is called a hallucination. And we haven't covered really hallucinations too much in
9:25:27
detail. And I'll just put this as a note, but hallucination
9:25:33
equals that know-it-all class
9:25:38
that think he knows his answer that thinks he knows the answer. It's wrong.
9:25:46
And it kind of goes back into what we're talking about with knowledge cutoff.
9:25:51
Your AI agent will always try to get you the answer unless you prompt it and say if you don't know the answer right I
9:25:57
don't know and obviously you can build out your orchestration based around it but your AI agent is always going to try
9:26:02
to get you the correct answer because of that there's something called hallucinations and you know it's common
9:26:08
to get you know 2% hallucination 5% hallucination 10% hallucination and our
9:26:14
goal is to limit hallucinations and we can do that by writing a phenomenal system message as well as a really great
9:26:22
user message when applicable. So, this is some of the basics. We have a lot
9:26:27
more to still talk about. I'm just going to take a quick break and we'll be right back. All right, so let's jump into the
9:26:34
next topics. So, the first is going to be how to write a good prompt and some of the different details associated with
9:26:40
it. I actually go through kind of a checklist each time. So, let's cover
9:26:46
each of these sections and uh we could just grab an AI agent, honestly. I'm not
9:26:51
too sure what prompt we're going to write, but we'll just open this up and I'll give you examples through it. And
9:26:57
uh let's go into our system message and expand this out. All right, so the first part of it is the role and identity. So
9:27:04
this is kind of what we have over here, your helpful assistant. So what we want to do is like what is
9:27:11
the role or the identity? And I'll just put this over here. what is the role or
9:27:17
the identity of the AI agent like what is its
9:27:22
objective right the next side of it is what tools
9:27:29
do we have available and I know we haven't covered setting up tools with our AI agent I did say I was going to
9:27:34
bring it on in this section but after we go over a few other things we'll cover
9:27:39
tools so what tools do we have available next what I would recommend is um how do
9:27:45
you want to handle errors? So, how do you want to handle errors
9:27:54
both as an agent and for the tool?
9:28:01
Okay. Another thing that you can define in over here is going to be your tone.
9:28:06
So what tone response
9:28:12
should the agent of? And some models are better with tone. Some are kind of bland
9:28:18
or vanilla, which is fine. Obviously depends what you want. what rules and
9:28:24
restrictions do you have in place?
9:28:31
And I should also mention externally uh you can also specifically
9:28:37
have restrictions based off of guardrails. So guardrails is a little
9:28:42
bit later on in this course. I'm just going to check my outline really fast. So this guard rails, where do I have it?
9:28:50
In the security and compliance section. So, um, still like five or six sections
9:28:55
away. So, let me give you a little bit of a sneak peek on guardrails and, uh,
9:29:01
not to ex out over here, but if we go into guardrails,
9:29:07
you can see check text for violations. So, what we can do is either go over
9:29:12
here and add in a guardrail like, hey, if this text is specific keywords or NSFW or PII, like don't run this agent.
9:29:20
And you can see like for example I put jailbreak and you'll see
9:29:28
we either have a pass or fail. So if it passes and go into our AI agent otherwise it fails and goes down that
9:29:35
way. A little bit about guardrails and we'll cover this in greater detail. All right going back to our AI agent.
9:29:42
Didn't want to um explicitly say this but you can also add on with guard. All
9:29:48
right. Um, what do we have next over here? Oh, our our shot prompting
9:29:54
examples. So, we've already covered that shot prompting examples.
9:30:02
We'll have additional context. So, like what other information
9:30:11
should an AI agent know?
9:30:16
All right. And then let's say our formats last formats.
9:30:23
And what we're going to say on the format is you can define it in here
9:30:31
if you don't care about passing it along.
9:30:38
Also, also add in output parser
9:30:43
which we've already covered, right? So let me give you a few of these
9:30:49
examples. What is the role or identity of the AI agents? And obviously like you shouldn't include all my all these notes
9:30:55
in the AI agent itself. Like don't have this and then write what is next. You'll
9:31:01
want to have this on its own. So for this example, right, and I'll just put maybe like a line so that way you know
9:31:09
are an AI agent that helps craft
9:31:16
viral posts based on YouTube videos. All
9:31:24
right, now let's think about the next thing. So, what tools do we have available?
9:31:32
Let's say we added in a tool, and this is all hypothetical. Um, but let's say we have a
9:31:38
um let me actually think about what tools. All right. Next. How do you want to
9:31:45
handle errors about the agent or the tool? I haven't really thought about the tool that I want to use for this scenario. So, we'll leave that out over
9:31:52
here. What tone? So, we're going to say use an excited tone
9:32:00
tone as this post should be for people
9:32:08
who are interested in evolving AI technologies,
9:32:18
the rules and restrictions that you have in place. This also guardrails. So, a lot of this is impactful if you have
9:32:25
like a chat trigger and people can message, but
9:32:31
you know, kind of my rules and restrictions all have to think about like what do I want to have as a
9:32:37
restriction for an agent that drives a viral LinkedIn post based off of YouTube
9:32:42
videos. So, um it's pretty self-explanatory,
9:32:49
but well, I actually have some ideas. We'll say like do not
9:32:55
include the YouTube URL
9:33:00
in the social media post media post text.
9:33:08
That could be just one example, right? Obviously, there's more things we could do. shot prompting examples. So, I'll
9:33:15
just say here are some examples of working
9:33:21
posts that you should should emulate. I would say like one
9:33:28
example, two example. Obviously, you're filling this out as you go. Three
9:33:34
example. Next, additional context. You know, I'd put over here a viral post has a hook
9:33:42
as a hook like XYZ. Then I'd say
9:33:51
a post asking someone to comment.
9:33:57
So this is just more information, right, that you want to feed into your large
9:34:02
language model or your AI agent in this case to give you what you want. format it, define it here, and then you could
9:34:08
also add an output parser. I' I'd obviously want to put an output parser, but I'm also say the final results
9:34:17
should only include the text. All right. So,
9:34:24
what tools do we have available? I don't Let me think of a tool that we might be able to use on the side of things. Like,
9:34:30
this probably wasn't the best for a tool. um you know obviously there's
9:34:35
things that we could utilize. However, on the tool side because we
9:34:41
don't really need any up-to-date information. This is pretty straightforward like
9:34:47
so in this case you won't need a tool in my personal opinion. However, if you have a tool that you would want, you
9:34:53
would define it like use tool X to
9:34:59
achieve Y. And then over here we're going to handle both uh the errors. So like if tool X
9:35:08
does not work right and then I would say if you cannot
9:35:14
write a post cannot write this post or aren't confident
9:35:23
about this post right
9:35:30
this will not work redo I don't know you have some type of
9:35:35
escape cost. So to break all these sections up of what takes like a a really good system message first what is
9:35:42
the role of uh the AI agent in this case right helping craft a viral LinkedIn
9:35:48
post what tools do you have available in this case I didn't set up any tools but you would define it right over here and
9:35:54
again we'll talk about this in the tool section how do you want to handle errors in both as agent as as well as the tool so if
9:36:02
this tool does not work do why do you cannot write this post or aren't confident about the post, write
9:36:07
something. So that way you kind of have some sort of fallback. What tone response should be the agent, right? So
9:36:13
like what tone are you going to use? That's defined there. What rules and restrictions should be in place? This
9:36:20
example include YouTube URL. Also, you can use guardrails. Um another example
9:36:26
would be like imagine you have a runner AI agent that just focuses on short distances. Well, someone should not be
9:36:32
asking that agent uh questions about ultramarathons. So someone's running a 5K. Uh so that would be an example over
9:36:38
here like I just talked about do not include URL. You put your examples in over here which really um decreases the
9:36:44
hallucinations. You put an additional context. So what other information should the AI agent know um that is not
9:36:51
available all over here and won't be available in that user message.
9:36:56
And then lastly, how do you want to specifically format your prompt? So we'll just leave this one like that. And
9:37:03
that is an example of a a pretty good basic understanding of writing a good
9:37:08
prompt. So I'll just put like this because you guys are going to be using these um as notes. So like write a
9:37:15
prompt and obviously like I would recommend that you just practice and write some good prompts because it is
9:37:22
something that it takes a while to ingrain all these individual elements. And every prompt doesn't need to have
9:37:28
every single element that we just covered. Like depends scenario to scenario, but that is essentially
9:37:35
looking at the prompt side of things. All right. Now, let's jump into some of
9:37:40
the different settings that are available. Now, settings are going to change slightly LM to LM, but we're just
9:37:46
going to go over here. We're going to grab an AI agent and we're going to talk through some of these. And uh yeah,
9:37:52
let's get started. So, we have our AI agent. All we're going to care about is just adding in OpenAI for now and choose
9:38:02
your account. Just going to choose GPT5 Mini over here. Although I don't believe it actually matters. Um, and you can see
9:38:09
over here we have different options. So, we have quite a lot of different options. I'm not going to cover every
9:38:15
single one of these. So, some of these are good if you're generating text. Some of these are good um
9:38:23
if you want to have slightly different results. I think like if you believe in like the 8020 principle really 80 to 90%
9:38:31
of your results your agent are going to matter based off of this prompt in the
9:38:36
system message and um probably like 5 10% really focus on these different
9:38:44
options. So let's talk about some of them. the frequency penalty over here.
9:38:49
This is a discouragement if the model uses the same phrases over and over again. And that's very similar to like a
9:38:56
presence penalty as well. Uh so you can see a presence penalty on there. So that's a penalty for reusing the same
9:39:03
word over and over again. Uh next you have something called timeout. Now this one is actually pretty powerful. So this
9:39:11
is like how long you should wait for a response from OpenAI and this is I believe in milliseconds if I remember
9:39:17
correctly. So like this one I would say matters a lot more than penalties over
9:39:22
here. Again just depends on your use case. Like if you're doing some sort of writing these matter like timeout I
9:39:29
think is pretty important over there. Another thing that's important too is
9:39:34
the maximum number of tokens. So on this side of things you can see it says maximum number of tokens to generate in
9:39:40
completion for models that have a context of 2048 tokens except the newest models which supports 32768.
9:39:46
So that is also important negative one means this does not matter. Um but if you want to set hard limits if you're on
9:39:53
a specific budget or you know like it should not send a response that's a certain length. I think this one matters
9:39:59
quite a bit. uh you have something called the sampling temperature also over here and um that's kind of the
9:40:05
randomness associated with it. Um then you have uh where is this one at
9:40:12
top P which is very similar and you can see it says control diversity 0.5 and so
9:40:18
we generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both. But here's the thing I want to say GPT5 got rid of
9:40:23
sampling temperature. So like this doesn't even really matter. I don't know if top P has been removed as well. And I
9:40:31
can see a lot more of these. Like there's a lot of different options over here. I don't know every single one of these. Um but some of these over here I
9:40:38
don't think are going to really matter too much here in the long term. So I just want to cover a few of these like I
9:40:44
think maximum number of tokens I think that's important. I think your timeout is important. I'd focus more on those
9:40:51
than some of the other stuff that I have specifically shared. We're going to cover the responses API here in a
9:40:56
second. Obviously, this is just uh very small section of the settings. And uh
9:41:02
yeah, so up next we're going to talk about tool calling and then we'll cover
9:41:07
responses because perplexity is going to be a tool that we add in. So let's jump into there. So we've already talked
9:41:14
about kind of how you can prompt an AI agent. I just want to show you the very basics behind tools. So we can go into a
9:41:21
tool and like click over here and we can have our agent do some sort of action.
9:41:28
So one of the basic examples is we could go and update a spreadsheet or we can go
9:41:34
and send an email. So if I go over here, you can see there's a Gmail tool. And
9:41:39
essentially what we can do if you set up your right Gmail account, you could send a message, you can delete a message, you
9:41:45
can reply, you could you have a lot of different options um that your AI agent can act based around. So you could have
9:41:51
a message to your AI agent and say, "Hey, send an email to X person about something." And let me show you how we
9:41:58
could do that. Let me grab our chat trigger, which I believe is like way up over here. Drag that all the way down
9:42:05
here. and uh let's build out something basic. So, we have our connected chat trigger
9:42:12
over there into our AI agent. And great, next thing we have our tool. And here's
9:42:19
something that kind of trips people up initially. It's like, how do I go and automatically populate information in
9:42:27
here? Well, if you see this over here, it says let the model define this parameter. So, you could actually let
9:42:33
the model choose, okay, who do I want to send the email to? You can also set the
9:42:38
subject automatically and the message automatically if you prompt it correctly.
9:42:44
You can add another options as well. So like I want to turn off the nan attribution by default. You can let the
9:42:49
model choose this parameter as as well as if you want. Um so there's your Gmail tool. You should also update the
9:42:56
description. So I'm going to say send instead of send a message in Gmail. Like I think that's fine. Sometimes certain
9:43:02
tools are a little bit ambiguous and the model won't know what to do. Uh but this is just sending and you can obviously
9:43:09
like there's a lot of things that you could do based around this and we already covered a lot about Gmail but
9:43:14
all those are applicable to your AI agent now which is really really powerful if you if you think about it.
9:43:20
Um we've set up Google and obviously we don't have to change our credentials over here and now we can have an AI
9:43:25
agent automatically send emails. That's pretty crazy. So to do this, let's go
9:43:30
over here and I'm going to say send an email to Ryan Nolan data@gmail.com.
9:43:43
So use the subject live AI agent.
9:43:50
I'm going to also say over here,
9:43:55
right in the body, this was live from a YouTube video.
9:44:05
We're going to send all that over. And I actually have an error. And the error is because I actually didn't set a
9:44:11
chat model. Oh, man. All right. We're going to go and add in uh Ladden Sonnet.
9:44:17
So, we'll go anthropic. It's cool. We have that over here. I'm going to close that out. We're going to
9:44:23
try this again. And you know what? Of course, I uh Cool.
9:44:31
We're going to go back to our editor. We're going to send this again.
9:44:36
Now it's working. You can see everything that's going on.
9:44:42
And let's see if we actually got that email or not. So, I'm going load up my Gmail account.
9:44:48
And I'm going to just go over here. Check it out. Live AI agent. This was a
9:44:54
live from a YouTube video. That's pretty sweet.
9:45:00
So, you know, we could going back over here. There's a lot of other tools. We
9:45:06
can update a spreadsheet as well. So, I'm going to just duplicate this.
9:45:12
Show you a spreadsheet. And I can literally like there's so many tools in the end you could literally spend days
9:45:17
just exploring all these tools to no end. And oh to mention as well like you can add in multiple tools from some
9:45:24
things. So like this sends a message in Gmail and I would also recommend that
9:45:29
you like define these. So like send a message in Gmail. Guess I have that somewhere else. Oh, you know where it's
9:45:36
at? I already have this here. All right, that makes sense. Why? Um you can duplicate this, right?
9:45:44
And then instead of send a message, maybe we want to create a draft
9:45:51
draft in Gmail and resource. You just go over here to draft and now you have two
9:45:56
Gmail tools over here for this AI agent. One sends a message, one creates a
9:46:01
draft. And obviously there's a lot of different options in Gmail and you can keep building them out. One thing to
9:46:06
mention though, when you add a lot of tools in here, it can confuse an AI
9:46:12
agent. So, think about what you want to add in if it's 100% necessary or you
9:46:17
want to add it to another AI agent because you don't want to overload it. And like you think, oh, I can send 100 tools to this AI agent. Like, come on.
9:46:25
Don't don't do that. Um, be uh specific as much as possible. Like, do I need
9:46:31
this or not? Just to show you spreadsheet really quick. Let's say like we want to add in a new row. Whoops. So
9:46:37
we want to add in a new row into a spreadsheet. So I'm going to do this really quick. I'm going to go find
9:46:43
spreadsheets. Should be sheets, not spreadsheets. So you can see there's a Google Sheets tool
9:46:50
and just add in your account that you want resource. Instead of get rows, I'm going to say uh append row. I'm going
9:46:58
add in a documents and I'm going to go into this sheet five. I want to say that was the one
9:47:04
that we were doing yesterday. Cool. So, we're going to add in an expense
9:47:09
and be explicit. So, tool description, append a row in Google Sheets.
9:47:16
This is when someone asks to add an expense. Great. So, I'm going
9:47:23
to prompt it and say add an expense of 100. And it's going to go through and do that. So, if I open the chat, I'm going
9:47:29
to clear this one out. I'm going say add an expense of and what's one that we haven't
9:47:35
covered yet? 51 100 12. Um, so let's add in expense of 75. And obviously like I
9:47:43
didn't write a great prompt by any means. And I actually have an
9:47:48
error over here. So what is my specific error? It says
9:47:55
problem nan at least one value has to be sent. And if you go over here, you can see values as send. I never actually
9:48:01
explicitly put something over here. Again, an error that most people make. So, I didn't mean to make that error,
9:48:06
but that's okay. We will run it again.
9:48:13
It's good that you guys see me make because everyone's human like no one's going to get things off the bat 100%.
9:48:19
You can see we have the green check mark. It's running still. Says workflow was successful. Go back over here. we
9:48:26
have 75 automatically added into our spreadsheet. Again, there is so many tools
9:48:32
like and we'll we'll be covering stuff as well when we get into vector databases a little bit later. Um, so you
9:48:38
can even have like AI agents as tools, generate an action plan, execute it, can use external tools, you can have
9:48:44
workflows as tools, you can apply for web scraping, which um really like
9:48:51
there's just so much over here. It's there's just too much to to cover in one video. However, you can think of like a
9:48:58
lot of different APIs and services. You can even add in external APIs over here.
9:49:03
If you go to HTTP, look at this. Makes an HTTP request and returns a response
9:49:09
data. So, uh, I'm recording this actually after the HTTP section, but you'll learn this
9:49:16
already a little bit earlier on in the course and I don't know if I'll put this specifically in that HTTP request aside.
9:49:23
I might however that which is pretty amazing. All right. So, we covered uh
9:49:30
tools now. And uh next thing we should talk about is essentially how do you get new data?
9:49:38
Because we talked about that issue where it's like, man, this is great and all,
9:49:44
but I I can't grab up-to-date information. So, we'll go over here and say how to add up-to-date information.
9:49:51
How to add up toate information. There's like there's a few different
9:49:57
ways, a few different approaches. We're going to go here very basic. We're go to our AI agent. I'm just going to
9:50:04
define this below. H actually we'll do a chat tracker and we'll just keep
9:50:10
expanding this on. So, one thing that's really nice is OpenAI has a responses API and that
9:50:18
allows you to get real-time information. So, make sure you're on a newer model.
9:50:23
And I should just delete this open AAI account 3. That was for old client. But we'll go over here to GPT5 mini. And you
9:50:30
can see by default we have responses API. And there is built-in tools because of the responses API. So what we can do
9:50:37
is add in web search. And you'll see it says med search context size. So high
9:50:42
level guidance for the amount of context window space to use for the search. I would probably just recommend keeping this at medium. If you're conscious
9:50:48
about price, do low. If you don't care, which might overload your context window, put high. I'm just going to keep
9:50:54
in medium. And we can ask a question. People always love the Pop Tart Bowl.
9:51:00
So, believe that was recently. Who won the Pop Tart
9:51:06
Bowl in 2025? And this is for college football. We'll throw this in over here.
9:51:12
And normally this wouldn't get the answer because GPT5 was not trained up through data um in December 2025, but
9:51:20
since we're using this specific tool, it says BYU won the 2025 Pop-Tarts Bowl and
9:51:26
has a link over to CBS Sports. Uh so you can click on that and double check that piece of information. So that's one way
9:51:33
if you just want to search the web in general. However, there's other things as well. So you can actually define a
9:51:39
domain if you want to search that. So, let's say I just want to search ESPN for college football scores. You can go to
9:51:45
ESPN.com and say that's like the only one available. But, as I mentioned, you could throw in multiple domains if you
9:51:51
want. Uh, so if there's multiple websites you want to scrape to get uptoate information, you can put that in. So, you can see web search. Uh, you
9:51:58
can also specify what country. I could go over here and say US. You could
9:52:03
specify what city as well as region. And this is good if you want to do research on businesses. So maybe you don't want
9:52:09
to have the specific domain over here, but you want to search a business that's maybe in Orlando, Florida or Sarasota,
9:52:16
Florida or Miami, Florida, and you could put all this in over here and just search for a local business news because
9:52:22
you want to do some research for a potential customer and have stuff to bring to a cult. So you could actually fill out all this information over here.
9:52:30
And I find it pretty helpful on that side of things. So that is one way that you could get up-to-date information.
9:52:36
Another way that you could do this is through a perplexity tool. So you're going to actually have to set up a
9:52:42
perplexity API key. And honestly, it's really easy. It says interact with the pro complexity API to generate AI
9:52:47
response with citations. So why perplexity is nice is it'll actually
9:52:52
give you links to real-time information. So you can think of this as like a mixture of Google search with large
9:52:59
language model. And it's it's phenomenal. So, just to show you, I'm going to load up Perplexity on a tab to
9:53:06
show you what this kind of looks like. And uh here you go. So, take a look at
9:53:13
this. You can ask the same question and it'll get answers. So, we're going to say like, I don't know, who won the
9:53:21
Pop-Tarts in 2025?
9:53:27
And you'll see it searches the web and literally 10 sources of information. So
9:53:32
you could attach this as a tool directly into our AI agent
9:53:38
directly in our AI agent over here to get real-time information. So it's kind of overkill if you use both of these
9:53:44
over here. So I just recommend one or the other. Like if you want to just have everything natively directly in the OpenAI ecosystem, you know, use this.
9:53:51
However, if you're going to use another model that obviously won't have access to the OpenAI responses, I would just
9:53:56
recommend use perplexity. You can obviously message the model. I would set a a description of why you're
9:54:03
using perplexity. The text you can define that over here as well. So, defined automatically by the model. And
9:54:10
I would just also mention over here like in our where's our system message
9:54:17
use perplexity to research
9:54:24
any related news in 2025. Obviously this is very short but I would
9:54:31
just recommend that you fill out this information really go in depth of like why should your AI agent use perplexity
9:54:37
as a tool like give that exact scenario now you think it's going to be possible
9:54:42
and then uh yeah so there's perplexity and honestly all you have to do is set up the perplexity API takes two seconds
9:54:49
so I'm going to go over here and say perplexity
9:54:55
and you go to the Perplexity API platform obviously they have a lot of things over here and you just have to
9:55:01
set up your API key. You should be very familiar with how to set up an API key as of now with uh all the stuff I've
9:55:07
taught you guys. And just to go back into any and like if we go into Perplexity credentials,
9:55:14
you can see it's literally just an API key. Um couldn't connect with these settings. So I actually need to update my Perplexity account. I guess I deleted
9:55:21
my key. Add some time and you know we'll have to update that. But regardless, all you have to do is throw in an API key
9:55:27
and you're good to go with perplexity. So that is up to date information
9:55:33
responses perplexity. The other tool that people use and I've never used it, but it's called Tavi. Um,
9:55:40
where is it? Let me find it really fast.
9:55:47
Thought it was called Tavi. How do I can't find it?
9:55:54
I don't know why I can't find it right now, but I believe it's tavly to get up to date information. Um, so that's another one over here.
9:56:00
Maybe it's a custom HTTP request right now. Again, I just haven't messed with it, but I just wanted to call that out.
9:56:06
All right. And, uh, going back over here. Lastly, just really quickly wanted to talk about memory before we jump into
9:56:14
two or three examples. Memory can be a little bit complicated in any end. And
9:56:19
all I'm specifically talking about memory is like the back and forth conversation. Uh, so you can see chat message received with the AI agent. I'm
9:56:26
just going to show you simple memory really fast. I might actually expand out and talk about a little bit more
9:56:31
complicated memory another time either in this course or on the YouTube channel. For sure on the YouTube channel. Um, but let me clear this out
9:56:39
and we'll just grab a fresh AI agent. So if you want to remember all these past
9:56:44
conversations with an AI agent, you're going to have to set up memory. And if
9:56:50
you click over here, the quickest way to do this is simple memory. So it says stores any end memory. No credentials
9:56:55
are required. You have credentials. You would use one of these over here. Honestly, the most popular ones that I
9:57:00
see people use is MongoDB as well as Postgress. That does deal with external
9:57:06
databases though, and it's a little bit complicated. So it's not going to be in this section. Again, it's probably going
9:57:11
to be a little bit later on in this course or it's just another video. Uh, but simple memory allows you to just
9:57:16
save those conversations back and forth over here. And just to show you like if
9:57:22
I asked the question. So like what is 30 times 11? Just 3:30. It's quick math.
9:57:31
You don't need it. But we'll go over here and go into Where's my Open AI?
9:57:37
There. Cool. We have OpenAI. go to account one GPT5
9:57:43
mini great and uh we'll just ask this
9:57:48
question and you can see by default we have
9:57:54
memory of five but I'm going to say now I did 20 it's going
9:58:01
to know that it already said 330 now it's going to say 350. So, if you want to have a conversation back and forth
9:58:08
with your chat, you need to add in simple memory over there. Man, I know this is a long section. I think like
9:58:14
we're well over an hour and we still have to do our two to three examples which I'll think about before we uh
9:58:21
quickly jump into those. But to kind of just recap everything that we've done is
9:58:26
like this is just a a very very long section for the course and it's really
9:58:33
critical that you um memorize these components. So not everything in detail
9:58:38
but kind of just you know where to go. So you have two different types of prompts. So you have a system prompt as well as the user prompt. You can think
9:58:44
of the system prompt as something that's not going to change unless want to tweak it and make it a little bit better.
9:58:50
Whereas the user prompt will change every time you run a specific model. Once you ask something a little bit
9:58:55
slightly different. Uh next you want to include as in there examples. Examples
9:59:01
is one way to stop hallucinations. It also provides some context on like how
9:59:06
you are you expecting specific responses. If you want to get a specific response so that way you can keep
9:59:12
passing it forward with the orchestration that you're building out structured output uh parser, you're
9:59:17
going to have to set up some example JSON. But really pairing that with your examples that you're going to provide with fus comps is going to help a ton uh
9:59:25
and really stop incorrect results and hallucinations. You can add in a lot of things. So we
9:59:32
talked about adding in your main model, your fallback model, memory as well as a tool and output parser. So, um, you can
9:59:39
al also have multiple tools, not just one, but I just showed that over there. Typically, I want to set one task per
9:59:45
agent. Obviously, it's like complimentary tasks. That's perfectly fine. But I find a lot of people will stuff too many tasks within the context
9:59:52
window of an AI agent and it gets confused or they just send a bunch of text. And really, you should build out a
9:59:58
rag application for that. We'll talk about rag a little bit later. You can kind of chain together multiple
10:00:04
agents to get results. So, this was just an example of that. Over there, we covered hallucinations, which you know,
10:00:11
hallucination is that know-it-all person in class that seems they think they know everything and they really don't. And
10:00:17
hallucinations, you know, they're part of the process with AI. You just have to be as careful as possible and try to
10:00:22
limit hallucinations as much as possible. I showed you how to write a prompt and the framework on it. So,
10:00:29
first thing I always define is like what's the role of the AI agent? If we're using any tools, what tools do we
10:00:35
have available? and why do we want to use that tool? How do we handle errors within the AI agent as well as those
10:00:40
external tools that we've provided? What tone of response should we have back? What rules and restrictions should we
10:00:47
have in place? Obviously, there's ways to restrict outside of the AI agent as well, such as guardrails, but you can do
10:00:52
that directly in over here. Uh shop prompting we've covered already so many different times. Hopefully, you
10:00:57
understand that. additional context like what other information should this AI agent know to get the exact result and
10:01:03
how do you want to format uh your final results as well. So make sure you include those when possible and when
10:01:09
applicable. We covered tools. There's hundreds of tools available in a thousands if you really include all the
10:01:15
HTTP requests that you could use for external APIs. Be super explicit. Why is this tool used and what should it do
10:01:23
specifically? Make sure you put that in the prompt as well as the tool description. You can click that star and
10:01:29
it'll automatically populate things. It says defined automatically by the model. Um up-to-date information really tavly
10:01:36
perplexity and open AI responses. Use one of those three if you need to get information. Remember knowledge cutoff
10:01:42
dates. A lot of models aren't even trained on 2025 data or if they're trained like halfway through the year. So if you need real-time information or
10:01:48
near real-time information, you have to specifically do that. If you want to have messages kind of saved, set up a
10:01:54
simple memory. And you can change this like the context window length. So how many pass interaction the model receives
10:02:00
as context and uh look up the pricing for the models. You go to their API you'll see all the specs as well like um
10:02:07
the first part is your input. How many what are you sending to the model and then what is that specific output and
10:02:12
typically output is going to be way more expensive than your input and every model has different limits on how much
10:02:19
context you can include and we could we could really turn this into a three four hour video. I'm trying to condense a ton
10:02:24
of knowledge all at once, but hopefully you have found uh this section valuable. So, we have two different examples to go
10:02:30
through in uh this section. Let's start with the first one, which is going to utilize multiple AI agents together. So,
10:02:38
essentially what we want to do is have agent number one do a content
10:02:44
summarizer. And there's going to be a better way to do this here in the future, but we're going to use our AI agent now for that. So you can like
10:02:52
summarize this blog post in three points, bullet points of main ideas. And then the second agent is going to be a
10:02:58
social media writer. So you can use tweets, you could use LinkedIn post, um, whatever social media account that you
10:03:04
specifically want. Obviously this better than what I have over here. And we're going to input in agent ones summary. So
10:03:12
uh, maybe we want to also have an edit set for the article. Edit set for the article. I want you to try this
10:03:19
yourself. I think this is pretty self-explanatory. Um, obviously I'll I'll show you how to
10:03:24
build it here in a second. So, pause the video. Three, two, one. Give it a shot for yourself and then uh we'll jump
10:03:31
right into it. All right. So, let's uh build this out. First thing I want to make sure that we have is our manual
10:03:37
trigger. And I just want to make sure I didn't use a manual trigger up here. I did. So, we're just going to drag this
10:03:43
down. Great. So, we have our manual trigger. Going to zoom in a little bit. And the
10:03:49
first thing I want to do is get our response API. So what we're going to have to do is set this up in OpenAI
10:03:55
again. So let's grab an AI agent and have that over here. And also we need
10:04:01
our edit set. So let's grab our edit set. We're actually going to paste our article over here on that side of
10:04:08
things. And uh yeah, so we have our edit sets. Well, the article I'm going to
10:04:14
grab on this side is this famous cricketer named Morani. It was also like a prince or something like that. I
10:04:20
actually have this as a card. Um, it's from like 1902. I didn't even realize that there is this was built in 1897,
10:04:26
which is kind of cool. So, we have that over here. We're going to throw that
10:04:32
into our edit fields and we're going to say this is the article we want to summarize. Obviously, choose whatever
10:04:37
article you want. I just felt like Wikipedia would be pretty easy to do. Uh, so we could just execute the step
10:04:42
and we have our article. Nothing really too crazy there. Then, we're going to use our chat model. Let's do OpenAI
10:04:48
because we're going to use the OpenAI responses for this use case. We can see responses is available. So add a
10:04:54
built-in tool. We're going to do web search select and we're going to do a web search allowed domains. Um we're
10:05:00
going to actually paste this in over here in a second. Um so what we have over here is this. We have that attached
10:05:07
into our AI agent. You can see the article and uh what I can do is just paste this in right there. Awesome. So
10:05:14
we have that. Obviously, we want to change our model. So, I'm going to go into GPT5 Mini. And
10:05:22
so, now what we're going to do is use this terrible prompt. Obviously, we'll make this a little bit better.
10:05:28
And uh we're going to go and change this to define below. I'm going to just put this article over here again just in
10:05:34
case. We're going to say article this. And then what we're going to do is build
10:05:40
out our system prompt. So go over here, add in a system message,
10:05:46
and we're going to just write this off over here. So let me make this a little bit larger
10:05:52
like that. And we're saying summarize this blog post in three points. So we're
10:05:58
going to start off as you are a blog post summarizer.
10:06:05
The goal is to write three key points
10:06:14
about an article. Beise
10:06:21
or have an escape. If you cannot write three key points, write as many as
10:06:30
possible. Right.
10:06:35
One or two. Right. Zero, one or two in
10:06:47
the other points state
10:06:54
no available to. All right. So, this is like a very
10:07:00
basic one. It's kind of hard to give an example but um without the full article but I'll say
10:07:06
over here example and uh WG Grace
10:07:14
founded Bricket
10:07:20
in we'll just put an exact date 1860. I don't know if that's accurate or not. Um,
10:07:27
Babe Ruth was both a pitcher
10:07:34
and hitter.
10:07:39
Can just throw another one over here as an example. Um, but we have those over here as two examples.
10:07:46
So, we have our example side of it. We have the task. We're going to add in the article as context. Um let's put over
10:07:54
here the goal to write three coins about an article concise the article
10:08:02
will be passed in the user message post
10:08:10
and going back to our framework which we had where was our framework
10:08:18
I want to say it was like one of these up over here right ro identity Hey, we covered that.
10:08:24
What tools? We're not really using any tools. We're going to use the responses API. We talked about handling errors.
10:08:30
Didn't really mention tone. We're just going to be pretty concise on that side of it. Um, we don't really have any
10:08:36
restrictions on that side of things. Maybe we'll say do not include the article URL. Maybe we can put that over
10:08:42
there. I put it some examples. It doesn't really need additional context. We talked about the format
10:08:48
being three sentences or three quick things. And I'll just put over here
10:08:54
um one extra thing examples
10:09:01
do not include the article URL
10:09:08
only output the three key points on
10:09:15
I think that's fine. So let's test this out and see what happens. And we got a bad request,
10:09:23
which is interesting. Invalid domain. Oh, you know what it is going to be? I
10:09:29
know exactly what's happening. It's just asking for Wikipedia on this side of things because we're just searching
10:09:35
Wikipedia. Um, that's fine. Do Wikipedia. Let's just go back over here to web
10:09:41
search allowed domains. And you can see it says Wikipedia.org. Wikipedia.org.
10:09:48
I wonder if we could also pass in the rangie. That's fine.
10:09:53
Cool. So, let's test this again. This should work. I just put extra stuff. I didn't follow
10:09:59
the instructions. All right. So, let's see what our results are. And you can see Indian
10:10:05
cricketer played 15. It actually referenced the link. It did not listen to me. Oh, that's annoying.
10:10:13
So, do not include the article URL. I did not listen to that.
10:10:19
Obviously, I can try to fine-tune this prompt, but I still think this should be able to be used for our next AI agent.
10:10:25
So, we're just going to skip into that. So, what we're going to do is build another agent. This is going to be our
10:10:31
social media writer. So, I'd also re label our agents as well. So, this is
10:10:36
content summarizer. Just get a good habit of that. I've haven't been really doing that throughout the series, but
10:10:42
that's fine. Social media writer. Cool. And obviously like if I wanted to spend more time, I could write this to
10:10:48
be a better prompt and tweak it so it doesn't actually paste out the URL. And it could be also a responses API. It
10:10:54
forces you to have a URL based around that. That might be the case. We could
10:10:59
always scrub it with another node or code node. It doesn't really matter too much. So I'm going to just lally keep
10:11:06
this over here like this. Again, terrible prompt, but we'll change this
10:11:13
up a little bit. We'll have to give some examples.
10:11:21
I'm going to keep the do not include this. I'll put the three
10:11:27
tweets. We're going to split this up in a second. All right. So
10:11:36
you are a Twitterx
10:11:43
tweet creator. Take these three key points and
10:11:48
write three engaging tweets. Use emojis and hashtags. Example. And let's
10:11:57
put an example over here. Now I'm not the best at Twitter. I don't have a
10:12:02
large following. So obviously I haven't figured out the platform. We'll just give an example. Dr.
10:12:09
WG Grace founded
10:12:14
cricket. Do you know his amazing
10:12:19
backstory? Read more. I don't know. We can do
10:12:25
something like that. And then we could have another one over here.
10:12:30
Most people know Babe Ruth
10:12:36
as a hitter, but he was an excellent
10:12:42
pitcher. Let's look at his unknown
10:12:50
pitching career. Again, these are probably pretty poor, but you get the point. Put some examples
10:12:57
over here. role additional information we have some examples do not include the
10:13:02
article URL I'll put the three tweets and uh let's find over here
10:13:09
and we should say like separate these tweets these tweets
10:13:17
oh you know what we need to do we need to um actually put an output parser over
10:13:23
here so the reason why I want to put output parser oh this is actually really
10:13:28
All right, cool. Cool. So, check this out. What we're going to do
10:13:34
is something like this. It probably won't make sense to you right away.
10:13:45
And if you are paying attention, maybe it will. Not to discredit people who aren't
10:13:51
paying attention because this is a little abstract. I don't even know if it'll work correctly. I think it will. All
10:13:58
right. Go
10:14:05
put over here and say key points.
10:14:11
Pass that in the output over here. Cool. I hope this works. Also, I need to pin
10:14:17
this data because I don't want to run that again. All right. So, let's see if this works. I'm really hoping it works
10:14:24
50/50. I might have to rework the prompt a little bit. Honestly, a lot of the time spent on
10:14:31
builds is kind of reworking the prompt to be honest with you because there's always so many nuances based off of what
10:14:37
a customer wants and what their expected output is. So, you have to like constantly fine-tune it. Oh, it did
10:14:43
work. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Check that out. Yes. All right. So, all right.
10:14:48
Here's the deal. Why I included it like this? Essentially, what I want is an array of tweets because we can break
10:14:55
this out. We can now have each of these become an item afterwards. So, I just said tweets, tweet one, tweet two, tweet
10:15:01
three. And what we can do now, if we go into our nodes, and I believe it's under
10:15:06
data transformations. Yeah, split out. So, check this out. We
10:15:12
haven't used split out in a while. Oh, this is perfect. This is perfect. Let me pin this data as well.
10:15:18
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet. Yeah, there we go. Okay, so we have our
10:15:26
initial article over here. We tell our content summarizer to read our article and uh specifically give us three key
10:15:33
points. Obviously, I'm just using Wikipedia for this example. You could change this up. Then what we do is we
10:15:39
create the tweets. Obviously, I would want to have some type of winning tweet on the platform and really build out a
10:15:44
thorough system message. This is like a very mediocre like a C minus system message. So, and then I essentially put
10:15:51
a structured output format or structured output parser over here. So, that way we have an array of different tweets which
10:15:57
makes it really easy for us to split this out. As you can see over here, all I did is pass in tweets. And now we have
10:16:03
three things. So, the first one, Rangi, an Indian prince who played 15 tests for England and later ruled I'm not going to
10:16:09
try pronouncing this. Um, rain from 1907 to 1933. From royal palaces to cricket
10:16:14
pitches, his life reads like a novel. I actually kind of like that. Over here we have some hashtags as well which we can
10:16:19
define like hey do we want hashtags or not that can go all go in the system prompts
10:16:25
batting the daring back foot play and popularized maybe even invented the silly leg lands a first class average of
10:16:30
56.37 says it all and then it says his legacy complex the rangy trophy carries his
10:16:36
name yet he was criticized for not promoting cricket in India and his secession to again I'm not going to
10:16:41
pronounce that sparked controversy so we have that over there and boom we
10:16:46
essentially split this out. And what's nice is we can essentially go into sheets if we really wanted to. I'm not going to do it just to save some time,
10:16:53
but we can go into sheets and upload each item individually as tweets or however you want to schedule these on
10:16:59
social media. So, that's pretty awesome. We have emojis in here. We have hashtags. We have this over here as
10:17:05
well. And again, I would just recommend for the social media side of things really build out a prompt a little bit
10:17:14
more complicated than this. I would take a look at what works in the platform and try to emulate that specifically into
10:17:21
the system message. So that way it can give you those specific results. Like I would mention what is considered a good hook. Give some examples of that. How
10:17:28
many characters you want in your tweet spacing like really build this out and
10:17:34
this is something I'm going to be doing in the future probably for repurposing my content because I I'll be honest my
10:17:39
Twitter kind of sucks and I need to research the platform. So I'll really build something in depth based around that. Like instead of this content
10:17:46
summarizer, I'll have something with a YouTube video and then the social media writer for each platform because there's things that work on Twitter that might
10:17:52
not work on LinkedIn. That is essentially it for our first one. Let's take a look at our second
10:17:58
example now. All right. So, our second example, it's going to be a little bit
10:18:03
more complicated. And this is actually going to involve an API as well. be honest with you, I have
10:18:10
not taken a look at this API, so I have no idea if it's a complicated API or not. We're going to go through it
10:18:16
together. So, essentially what we're going to do over here is we're going to do a comparison. So, like we input
10:18:22
compare iPhone 17 to Samsung S25. These are newer phone models. I assume models
10:18:28
don't have that information. We're going to use Perplexity this time to search for uh news for iPhone 17. We're going
10:18:35
to use another side of Perplexity to search for the Samsung S25. Then we're going to use an HTTP request
10:18:41
to fetch prices from Best Buy's API. We're going to use all three of these and use another AI agent. I know it says
10:18:50
open AAI chat model, but it's fine. And then we have all this context from Perplexity on those to open AI results.
10:18:57
And then we'll just write a summary. So again, if you guys want to give it a shot first, this is the API by the way,
10:19:04
developer.b best buy.com. I found it for here. And you can see there's documentation as
10:19:11
well. And we're just going to fall through. This could be like a super fast
10:19:18
example or this is going to be something that bites me back and uh it might take
10:19:24
a while to figure out and might make some errors. But either way, I thought this would be kind of cool to go through. So feel free to try this out
10:19:30
for yourself to change the products if you want and I will work on the solution
10:19:35
here shortly. All right, let's get going. So I know I put manual trigger over here. We could start with that or
10:19:41
we could do a form and just put in each of these. So um let's do the manual
10:19:47
trigger or first and we're going to go manual trigger
10:19:53
and actually we have already manual trigger above. So we are off to a great start. All right. Then we're going to do
10:19:59
just an edit set. Obviously, you could do a chat trigger for this, but I'm just going to go edit
10:20:05
set for this route. And we're going to do a manual mapping. And we're going to just call this
10:20:11
compare. And we'll use the same exact string over here.
10:20:18
iPhone 17 to Samsung S25. So, we'll use that. Then, what I want to
10:20:25
do is build out an AI agent. So, we're going to say AI agent like this. This is a pretty easy one. We're not really
10:20:31
going to have to do much with this AI agent. I'm just going to pin this data.
10:20:36
Oops. To and pin it. Cool. So, all we're doing on
10:20:43
this, we should use a very cheap model because this task is simple. All we're doing is asking to extract the two
10:20:50
products. So, we're going to also put structured output formats. Let's go
10:20:56
output parser. Great. And uh we'll say
10:21:01
products.
10:21:07
Product one. We'll put product two. Next.
10:21:14
Two. We need to have that double quotes. Great. So, we're in a good start.
10:21:21
We're going to use OpenAI. Okay, we're going to use the cheapest model, GPT5 Nano. Uh, I'm sure there's cheaper
10:21:28
models out there. Well, there is, but I'm going to use US cheapest
10:21:34
that side of things. Cool. Turn off responses. We don't need that. Go to our agent. All I want to say on here is for
10:21:41
our prompts, add option system prompt. or you are an
10:21:47
AI agent that takes
10:21:53
the comparison text which I misspelled comparison that's all
10:21:59
right and extracts the two products
10:22:08
can say example tops
10:22:14
versus panini Um, we'll say Yankees or Red Sox.
10:22:26
And I should just say for and not. Man, look at that spelling. Terrible. All right. So, we have both these. We'll say
10:22:33
user for these. User is what we're trying to do is just give
10:22:39
a few examples. We'll say AI. Right.
10:22:54
But just literally giving the example what
10:23:01
it should be. This is pretty self-explanatory.
10:23:06
Simple prompt. So all we should get is iPhone 17 and Samsung S25.
10:23:13
Hopefully that works. Cool. It works. You can see over here we
10:23:20
products. Great. Next thing what we need to do is split this apart.
10:23:25
So do essentially what we covered over here with the split out.
10:23:32
Paste that there. Lot of action today with the split out.
10:23:37
Not on purpose by any means like that. Um, we're going to pin this also just to save some costs. Not that we need it.
10:23:45
Then we're just going to go the products. We should have two products. Great. We have both of those.
10:23:52
And uh, actually, I'm trying to think. Should we
10:23:58
Maybe we don't need to split these out.
10:24:05
Hold on. We might actually need to split these out. I'm I'm just thinking about this architecture really quick or we might
10:24:12
need to for the best by API. I'm going to save this really quick over here. I don't know if we need to
10:24:19
let me think of this. All right, this is on the fly thinking. So, we need to do a perplexity node.
10:24:26
Perplexity run message a model. Obviously, we could use this in AI agent. I just wanted to
10:24:32
change things up.
10:24:39
All right. So then we're going to do I think this is my Perplexity account. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's this one.
10:24:45
We're going to go over here. Let me text. So let me just click this.
10:24:50
Couldn't connect. It's Plexity 2.
10:24:57
All right. I think it's Perplexity 2. That's my actual account. All right. We're going to say based on the product
10:25:06
and we're going to feed in a product over here.
10:25:13
Search for its specs and latest reviews. Based on the product
10:25:19
and say search for specs.
10:25:27
Okay. So, we're going to have a product that goes through here.
10:25:32
Right now, if I build it like this, each product goes individually one at a
10:25:38
time into this, which I think it's probably the route we want to take.
10:25:44
Yeah. Yeah. What we're going to do is we're going to we're going to split this out and then we're going to put everything. That's what I'm kind of
10:25:50
thinking right now. So, we were split out. This is fine. Then what we're going
10:25:55
to do is go into perplexity based on the product. We're going to put this product over here.
10:26:03
This gets us our newest information. Um obviously like we can make this way
10:26:08
better as well. Can add an options over here.
10:26:14
I think this is fine. Let's just see what the results are look like.
10:26:21
Search at specs and latest reviews. Yeah, that's fine
10:26:29
because we're going to need the best by API still. And I think what we're going to do is probably split this apart. So,
10:26:34
we have two items. We have citations over here. Search result choices.
10:26:42
Have a lot of text. Cool. All right. This should be fine. So, this is probably where the best by
10:26:50
API is going to go. I'm gonna say like best by API. Both of these
10:26:57
best buy API goes here. We should probably solve that. I'm going to say
10:27:02
it's a HTTP request again. I've never looked at the head
10:27:07
best by API. So I have no idea what in stores for us. We're going to have to
10:27:12
merge after that because we're doing perplexity
10:27:18
and then HTTP request specify API. Then we're going to have another agent that essentially takes everything. Also, you
10:27:24
don't need an agent here. You could use a basic LM chain, but we haven't really covered that yet. Cover it a little bit
10:27:30
later. All right. I need to have another AI agent after we do a merge.
10:27:37
So, we're going to have this AI agent over here. We're going to have a merge. Also, since we're going to be doing a
10:27:43
summary on this side of things, I would probably recommend to use a little bit of a better model that side of things,
10:27:51
but uh we'll cover that here in a second. All right, let's take a look at Best Buy. So, we have all the
10:27:57
documentation over here. We should probably get an API key and look at the documentation. So, I wonder where we
10:28:04
have like pricing, things like that.
10:28:10
All right, there's pageionation as well. A lot going on.
10:28:17
I think the first thing we should do is sign up. Hopefully, it's a fast API to sign up for. It's not uh
10:28:24
garbage. I wouldn't say garbage, but you know what I mean. Um, okay. So,
10:28:30
only returns SQ name and price for the products. All right. Well, we we'll go through the documentation. Let's
10:28:36
actually sign up for this really fast.
10:28:43
I need to create an account. All right, let me do this. We're going
10:28:49
to just cut this out. Then I got this email just to verify my email
10:28:57
and apparently it doesn't work. We're going to try it again.
10:29:02
Okay, apparently this link does not work from Best Buy. Let me see if I can go to my dashboard.
10:29:10
Free email and edge is not allowed at this time.
10:29:16
Well, I could use my actual email for my
10:29:21
website. However, the problem is not all of you guys are going to be able to get
10:29:27
access to this API. So, I wonder if like another website has
10:29:37
we could use. I apologize because essentially what I was going to try to do and maybe we can just mock this up. I
10:29:45
was trying to get us to use an API to get real-time prices.
10:29:50
So, maybe let me let's ask Claude really quick. I'm going to put Claude in another screen. I know this is a little
10:29:56
bit off and some of you guys might not like this, but you know what? It's okay.
10:30:04
We're going to try to go through this. Cool. I'm literally just going to say
10:30:10
I'm trying to use the Best Buy API to use the Best Buy API to compare prices
10:30:19
of phones. However, it doesn't allow free email
10:30:26
addresses. Are there any alternative sites
10:30:40
we use that will allow for this?
10:30:47
And why I'm doing that, just to show you guys like what happens if I have a problem. Maybe a customer said I should
10:30:52
use the Best Buy API and they can't access it as well. So do some research. I'm using Claude here. Obviously, I
10:30:58
could use Perplexity, but I feel like this might help. All right, so it says
10:31:04
fake store. No, I don't want that. Dummy JSON potential. We could use Amazon. It says
10:31:10
use web scraping. And uh man, that's that's really
10:31:16
annoying. I mean, I can do web scraping as well. Did we cover web scraping? I
10:31:21
just want to double check. I think web scraping was last section. I'm recording these a little bit out of order. We
10:31:27
could use web scraping. Um
10:31:33
will fire crawl allow me to web scrape by? It might.
10:31:40
We could try it. They have a native node.
10:31:46
So, we could extract from a page.
10:31:53
And I know for you guys, you're like, "Oh, you explained it last lesson, but I'm literally recording this section 16
10:31:58
before our web scripping one." So, should be able to extract data. I don't use firecrawl every single day.
10:32:06
URLs. All right. I have an idea. Yeah. Let's see if this works.
10:32:13
So, we're going to look for Best Buy iPhone or Best Buy.
10:32:19
What was the model? S25 Galaxy
10:32:25
S25. Best Buy. We might actually change this up a little bit, but
10:32:32
let's see what it has over here. I will grab one of these. Um,
10:32:39
all right. We'll grab this. I think this is like a standard model.
10:32:46
I'm very curious if Fire Call will get this or not. Let's
10:32:51
just test it out. So, let's say we have to figure out how to get these product URLs still.
10:32:58
And um, let me just double check I'm in here as
10:33:04
well. Connection tested is successfully. This is going to extract our data. There's different operations as well.
10:33:09
Just double check. Have a website. You get URLs. Scrape a URL and get its content. We should probably just scrape instead. So, here's the URL because we
10:33:17
can always clean this up after. Um, crawl website. We're not going to use that. List of crawlers. Again, all this
10:33:23
will be covered in uh the previous video. Extract data. We might use extract data there, too. Let's uh scrape
10:33:30
first and see if this is actually even possible. We scraped it. And you can see we have a value over here as well as
10:33:36
this price. So that's the scraping example.
10:33:42
Fortunately, the best buy API did not work. Let's see the other one if we can try the other URL.
10:33:49
Instead of scrape, we're going to extract data. We're going to add in that URL
10:33:56
prompt. I will just say extract the final price of the phone.
10:34:04
All right. And then property, we should put like price.
10:34:11
So we'll just say price like that. That's all we care about. Let's see if
10:34:17
we can get No. Oh, the URL is off. I don't know why
10:34:23
that was off there. That's kind of weird. All right, let's try it again.
10:34:32
Check your parameters having something else. We have the URL
10:34:39
there. It looks correct. Extract the price of the phone
10:34:46
schema. Define the structure of the extract data. I mean, that's really all we need.
10:35:01
I mean, I think this should be fine. We might just use the scrape of the URL. I mean, we'll test this one more time.
10:35:08
We're going to have 400 code. Obviously, something's wrong on my side.
10:35:13
That's fine. This uh we can feel free to test this out, but
10:35:20
this will essentially do that. So now I need to think this through. It's like okay, we have
10:35:27
we have this information. Now I need to get the URLs. So how do I
10:35:32
get the URLs now? So that way I can pass it in. And if I test this again, like I
10:35:38
just want to pin this. Can I from this markdown? Can I get the actual final price? So what I want to test as well is
10:35:46
that we're going to use another cheap AI agent over here. pass that over here
10:35:51
like that and we're going to test. So let's
10:35:57
try it out. So what I'm going to do is pass this in here. We're going to pass
10:36:03
in this markdown. That's the only thing we care about right now. Now I'm just going to say based on the markdown can
10:36:08
you provide the final price based
10:36:14
on the markdown in the user message. Can you extract
10:36:23
final price? All right, let's test this out. We need to
10:36:30
change this up. And we'll say price. And what we're going to do is just put
10:36:37
something over here like 500
10:36:43
64. Let's see if that works. All right,
10:36:48
let's test this out. We're going to unpin it.
10:36:58
again. I wish we could have used the API. Look at that. $8.99.
10:37:03
Sweet. Okay, so that's fine. We don't need the API. We
10:37:10
used fire call. We extracted it out. So now we need to think about like, all right, how how do we get these URLs?
10:37:17
Like because I don't want to manually get these URLs. So we get our AI agent over here.
10:37:23
Great. Then we message a model perplexity. I'm just wondering now it's like okay
10:37:31
and there's a lot of different ways we could find this price. I'm just trying to think like what would
10:37:38
be the easiest. So I know fire crawl has other nodes as
10:37:43
well. I'm wondering if we go fire crawl again and search something for a site.
10:37:48
They might have that. Search and optionally scrape each search result. That actually might be it.
10:37:55
Map a website and get URLs. There's too many URLs on Best Buy for that. Oh, a website. Might be able to do that.
10:38:02
Like crawl the site and then get the URLs there. But I feel like there'd be a more efficient way.
10:38:10
Cancel a crawl job, extract data. I feel like Perplexity would be really good at just finding the
10:38:17
URL. So, let's try that.
10:38:23
So, this we might want to change as well based on the product searched specs and latest reviews. We might try this again
10:38:28
on the other side. So, I'm going to say and we're going to try this out. And again, I don't know if it's going to
10:38:34
work yet or not. based on the product. Find
10:38:42
on Best Buy that is not out of a stock.
10:38:48
All right, this might work. And maybe we might have to put an AI agent here instead of just
10:38:54
this perplexity node. I'm going to say only return the URL.
10:39:02
So thinking through this, we're going to have the product here. I'm asking it to find it on Best Buy. It's it's like a
10:39:08
web search and then I'm saying to only return the URL.
10:39:13
Simplify output rather only return essential fields, ID, citations, message. Let's simplify that out. Add
10:39:19
options. Search domain filter.
10:39:27
Ooh, this is good. So, we can only search Best Buy. We might as well throw that in.
10:39:35
So, we throw that there. That might not work. But
10:39:41
search recency filter. Yeah, it should be the last month.
10:39:48
Output randomness. We don't need the temperature using sonar. Let's try this
10:39:53
again. And we might have to actually use an AI agent. But
10:40:00
we have the iPhone 17 here. Does this work?
10:40:08
We need to get the actual product page though.
10:40:15
That did not work for that one. And then
10:40:23
I mean, it's close. It's close, right? But this isn't the exact piece of
10:40:29
information I want. And I need to prompt this better. So, and I need to prompt this better. So, we
10:40:36
said based on the product, find one euro on Best Buy that is not out of stock. The URL
10:40:44
should be that of where I could I can purchase the phone and not show a phone
10:40:54
plan. For example, buying an iPhone
10:41:04
for $1,000. I don't know. We're just gonna try this and see if that works.
10:41:10
Probably not the best, but we'll test it out. All right, so we have another two URLs.
10:41:17
Let's see what happened this time. That link, it does not work.
10:41:24
See this link? Okay, that does work. We should also
10:41:30
mention these are base models or something like that. Or maybe we need to look at unlocked version. I think that might be the best approach. All right.
10:41:36
So, find one URL on Best Buy that is not out of stock. The URL should be that of
10:41:43
an unlocked version of the phone. And obviously,
10:41:49
this is going back into, you know, you're fine-tuning this for a specific domain. Maybe we're doing phone
10:41:54
searches. So, based on the provide one URL, Best Buy does not should be that of an unlocked version of the phone.
10:42:01
It should have a price to purchase it at
10:42:08
and is the base model only return the All right, let's try this again.
10:42:16
At least you guys get to see some prompt engineering. All right, so it says no matching indicate iPhone unlocked
10:42:22
models. There are carrier locked. Is that the case? I I don't know enough
10:42:28
about phones. And if it is the case, maybe we just compare Verizon to Verizon. Like this gets me the unlocked
10:42:35
one. Does iPhone really not have an unlocked version
10:42:44
or is it only iPhone 17 that there's specific ones?
10:42:49
It looks like maybe iPhone 16's the reason why. Let's just change this to iPhone 16 and see what happens.
10:42:57
And obviously it I'm glad there's the fallback which tells us what happened.
10:43:02
This is a little bit annoying, but is what it is. All right, so we're going to compare the iPhone 16 to Samsung there.
10:43:12
We're going to unpin that. Well, we can just change that to 16 there.
10:43:18
Cool. We're going to unpin that. Execute step.
10:43:24
Pin it again. Oh, let's try this.
10:43:30
So, we have iPhone 16. Let's check that out.
10:43:36
It was wrong again. Wow. I mean, there's other ways to take
10:43:44
a look at it. I would have thought uh Perplexity would
10:43:50
be the best one right out of the gate. It's the product. Find one URL in Best Buy that is not out of stock.
10:43:56
The URL should be that of an unlocked version. It should be. Double check the results. Double check
10:44:04
the results and make sure there is a price on the page before
10:44:13
returning the URL. Let's try it one more time.
10:44:22
I might think like SER API where we scrape the Google search results and I think there's a way to do in fire call
10:44:28
also might be the best approach now if this doesn't work.
10:44:35
Wow. I mean I wonder if this used to be the URL. Let's check one. No.
10:44:43
All right. We need to think this through again. So
10:44:48
let's go to firecrawl because firecrol does have an option to search Google I want
10:44:55
to say. So search and scrape search results. All
10:45:01
right, this is what we want to look at now.
10:45:06
And we might not even need to scrape and get his content, but we'll double check this. All right, so fire call search and
10:45:12
we're going to have a query. So, let's
10:45:18
search that. We're going to put our product. We're going to say
10:45:25
unlocked Best Buy. All right. So,
10:45:31
expanding this out. Let's just see what the search results look like. Right now,
10:45:39
we're just going to go to the first one. All right. So, that doesn't work.
10:45:50
It's interesting that these always go to the plans first before it actually goes to the model.
10:45:56
All right, so what does this look at? Apple iPhone unlocked.
10:46:03
All right, so let's see what the search results look like. Web timeout limit. We'll do limit 10
10:46:11
and we'll test it out.
10:46:17
Use a custom body if we want.
10:46:23
All right, let's try this off.
10:46:34
So, we have all these web URLs now. And essentially what we'll have to do is
10:46:40
figure out what in that URL would have that result that we care about.
10:46:48
So let's look at these URLs.
10:46:54
We have the title description. We I think this is the one that we want,
10:46:59
right? It's unlocked. Or was it one of these
10:47:08
unlocked black? That might be it.
10:47:15
All right. So, it gave us two items. That's an example of a URL that we want
10:47:21
this notes.
10:47:30
So, that's an example. because we need to have some sort of
10:47:36
filter before it goes over here to get that price because obviously we don't get the price here. I'm just going to
10:47:41
pin this as well. All right. And then Best Buy.
10:47:49
So, I'm looking at this. We honestly might need something that just has unlocked with dashes next to it. You can
10:47:56
see this doesn't work. So, let's add in a filter. I think this might be it.
10:48:03
I have an idea. This won't always work, but imagine we're just scraping Best Buy and
10:48:10
let's figure this out together. So, we're going to put in a filter
10:48:16
and what we're going to take a look at is this URL. We're going to say contains
10:48:22
and we're trying to find unlocked, right? So, we'll say unlocked like this because if you look at the URLs, that's
10:48:28
not correct. That's not correct. Obviously, we want best buy.com. So,
10:48:35
we'll have to make sure bestbuy.com is in one of these. So, let's just add another condition. And we're going to
10:48:42
say this URL going to say also string
10:48:50
contains bestb.com.
10:49:00
slash product. All right. So,
10:49:07
all right. So, we have the Samsung Galaxy here. Okay. So, we need to split out these
10:49:13
URLs first. Before we do that, you can see it. Okay.
10:49:20
I know. I know what we need to do. Let's split out these URLs.
10:49:26
first before we actually do that. This is turning into a more complicated build than I anticipated. I thought it was
10:49:33
going to be pretty easy. That's all right. Okay. So, give this split out.
10:49:38
Let's split out
10:49:44
web if this is or not.
10:49:51
Right. So, we split these out. I only care about the URL now. So, let's do an edit set
10:49:58
set. We're going to pass in just the URL,
10:50:05
right? So, have that
10:50:12
have iPhone and the Galaxy. Great, great, great. Okay. So, now let's try this filter.
10:50:22
We need to change this out though.
10:50:28
Let's use URL. I think this should be it though because
10:50:34
we only want the product page because we don't want slash site one slash product.
10:50:40
I think that will give us these two URLs
10:50:45
and then we'll do a limit for each of these. All right, we've got three URLs. We're pretty good. Um, let's remove
10:50:52
duplicates because you can see this is a duplicate. Oh, actually it's not a duplicate.
10:50:57
Almost there. We are almost there. Okay. So,
10:51:03
we need to figure out a way to remove that third product.
10:51:11
Okay, that is not too bad. Almost there. At
10:51:17
the final stretch. Let's think about this for a second. So,
10:51:23
we have Galaxy S25 120 AC Blue. I just want to see why there's two different
10:51:30
ones there. So, this is $6.99. Okay.
10:51:36
What's the difference between these? Okay. This item is no longer available
10:51:41
in new condition. So maybe we actually want to have all of these
10:51:48
and we'll have three items just in case like one is out of stock. Like again, we're scraping Google.
10:51:55
We have only like five URLs for each of these. And obviously we can expand this out. I think this is a good fail safe
10:52:01
system just in case. All right, let's test this out. So what we're going to do
10:52:06
now is paste each of these URLs into over here. It's going to filter out
10:52:11
automatically. You watch what's going to happen. So we have this URL and what I'm
10:52:17
going to say based on the final markdown can you extract the final price if there is no price
10:52:25
only output zero. So we have a fail safe and we're just
10:52:31
going to filter out the zeros at the very end because if you look we put a final price there. So watch what's going
10:52:38
to happen now. We go to this extractor and pin this. I execute the step. We're
10:52:44
gonna get the markdown now for each of those URLs.
10:52:50
And obviously, like I apologize for this being so long. I still hope you guys find value. So, we have markdown for
10:52:55
each of these. And you can see this third one's just not going to work.
10:53:01
And now we're going to test this in our AI agent. Obviously, I want to pin this again so we don't run music cost.
10:53:10
Just double check that this is correct. Okay, execute the step.
10:53:16
Feel like we're almost there. And to mention as well for production,
10:53:22
there's things I would change 100% for this, but we're just going to test these two phones.
10:53:29
All right, take a look. 659, 699, and zero. Wow. I'm almost there. Let's just
10:53:35
double check. I think it was correct. That's $6.99.
10:53:41
All right. 659. That was correct there. And then we said $6.99.
10:53:49
Oh, we got it. Even with the discounts. Look at that. So, let's pin this data.
10:53:54
And then what we're going to do Oh, you know what we need as well? This is annoying. All right. We need to update
10:54:02
this as well because I don't know what each of these
10:54:08
are and we need to make sure that they match. Well, actually, no, because we have I guess we have this information
10:54:15
here. If I execute this step again, however,
10:54:22
there could be a scenario. There could be the scenario where these
10:54:29
are out of order in some capacity. It was always going to be iPhone then Android for this one just based off of
10:54:35
the search. However, down over here, like what happens if there's two iPhones
10:54:42
and then Android? Like the the order is going to be out. It's not going to be sorry. It's going to be out of order. So
10:54:47
we need to pass also the phone
10:54:54
or like oh man you can see like when you start
10:55:00
building these advance there's always like these edge cases. All right. So, we're going to say phone
10:55:07
iPhone 16.
10:55:15
Great. And should we put the URL? I feel like we should put the URL as well.
10:55:24
URL. Feel like it has the URL. All
10:55:31
right, let's try this one more time. I did like these results, but we just want
10:55:37
to specify that.
10:55:47
I might have to change that prompt though for the output. I might it might literally just be one
10:55:54
extra line that says also prints out the the phone type as well as you know.
10:56:00
Well, and maybe I want to print colors. I want to see if this works though out of the box. If it does, fantastic.
10:56:08
And we'll just throw that here. That is empty. Weird.
10:56:18
All right. So we need to write this as a prompt. Also
10:56:25
output the phone brand
10:56:31
and the URL
10:56:36
you're unsure both the phone rand
10:56:45
as an IDF. All right, let's try this again.
10:56:51
I think I'm also using the cheapest model here. If I remember correctly, we're using Nano. I would I if it
10:56:57
doesn't get it correct, I'm going to change this into mini because it is such a bad model. Okay, I'm not going to say
10:57:03
it's a bad model. It's a cheap model. Um, so you get what you get with it.
10:57:10
That's that's fine. I should have been more explicit and said like the brand and the phone type, but for now this is
10:57:17
fine because we have Samsung, we have the URL there. This is a header skip which is
10:57:23
interesting enough. All right, we're good. We're good. This we have the phone URL as well as the price. So now what we
10:57:29
need to do is filter out the zero. Also should think about like
10:57:36
how we want to only have one of these. Maybe a more advanced case would be to
10:57:42
use a code node and loop through these and just grab, you know, the one of
10:57:48
these that looks correct. We're not going to cover the code node yet, so I'm not going to worry about that. We're just going to filter this out for zero
10:57:54
and assume that every time we get these, it's going to be correct. All right, so filter this out
10:58:01
over here. I say value
10:58:06
number has to be greater than and a phone should not be less than 100 bucks.
10:58:11
So we'll execute that step and you can see it keeps the two items. All right, we have iPhone in there. Next, what
10:58:19
we're going to do is attach that over here. So this input goes there. This
10:58:25
input goes over here. We're going to do now these
10:58:32
combine by position. We could combine by other stuff, but it's fine.
10:58:40
Have all this great. We have our our thing over here.
10:58:48
We should also probably clean this up really quick. So, I go to edit sets just
10:58:54
because there's a lot of junk. like we should clean up the junk first before it goes into the merge.
10:59:01
So, what do we have over here that we actually need? So,
10:59:08
we don't need all the usage there. You just need to have the
10:59:14
content. That's it.
10:59:20
That's all we need. All right. So, now we merge these in over here.
10:59:27
execute step. We have the choices which is from perplexity and we have our output there.
10:59:36
And what we're going to do now is summarize.
10:59:43
Let's think this through. So we have our choices there and our output.
10:59:53
So we have the final price. So I'm thinking we do two nodes. We do
10:59:59
one that just does like a five sentence summary about the price and URL.
11:00:07
Then we'll combine them together at the very end and do a comparison. I don't know. I'm trying to think this through.
11:00:14
Um I think we might be fine. Might be fine.
11:00:25
All right, let's just do a summarize over here.
11:00:32
We're going to do is paste in both of these.
11:00:41
We're going to append, not append, concatenate. We're going to do a new line or actually let's do a custom
11:00:49
other. We'll do a space slashn like that.
11:00:56
I think this is how we want to do it.
11:01:04
Do the same thing here. Just want to see what this looks like.
11:01:16
other. All right, let's execute this step. Concatenated. Great. You can see these
11:01:22
are new lines slash new lines. And then what we're going to do,
11:01:30
let's use a better model. Let's use sonnet over here. So it's you're paying a little bit more,
11:01:36
but you're going to get better results. And now we need to write our message.
11:01:42
Again, you did not expect this to be this long. I really apologize. So,
11:01:48
we're going to say reviews and specs.
11:01:57
Going to say pricing for all.
11:02:03
Now, are a phone. You're an iPhone. I don't
11:02:10
know. You're an iPhone. Not iPhone. You're a phone comparison
11:02:18
article writer. I don't know if I like that.
11:02:24
You are to compare two phones
11:02:31
and talk about their specs and pricing. Specs
11:02:37
pricing. Let's go back over here and say the
11:02:42
phones are separated by this.
11:02:48
The phones are separated by this.
11:02:55
Okay. Make sure
11:03:01
comparison is three to five sentences.
11:03:08
for each phone. And then
11:03:20
the link, this is like not the best prompt, but
11:03:28
to compare our two phones, talked about their specs and pricing. I talked about how they're getting separated. Make sure to the comparison is three to five
11:03:34
sentences. We're just going to fix the spelling mistakes really fast and we're going to test this out.
11:03:42
A lot going on over here. Maybe paying a pretty penny from Claude for this one, but that's fine. We just want to test
11:03:50
this out. And uh let's take a look. iPhone 16 versus Samsung Galaxy S25 comparison.
11:03:58
iPhone 16 delivers Apple signature premium experience powered by A18 chips.
11:04:03
It offers excellent performance 30% better at 170 grams. It maintains
11:04:09
comfortable lightweight design. Price $6.99. Buy at Best Buy. It gives me the link as well over here. Then it says
11:04:16
Samsung S25. Talks about that over here. Top
11:04:21
performance. Take a look. Price by Best Buy.
11:04:26
I think that's our workflow. Obviously, there's things I would change like first
11:04:32
over here like I would make a note and say what happens if there's multiple
11:04:37
like this is something that would have to change. What happens if multiple
11:04:44
have over $0? Like we haven't figured that out. So
11:04:49
that would be another step to work out. Obviously, I want to get through this pretty fast, but the overall we take in
11:04:57
our string, which could be a chat trigger. We split out the products, which is a split out. Uh, first we use
11:05:03
Perplexity to do some research on reviews and what the models have. And maybe we could have factored in reviews
11:05:08
a little bit more towards the very end for that three to five sentences. Then what we want to do is scrape Google to try to find specific URLs uh from Best
11:05:16
Buy. Uh, we do that over here. We get the top five for each of those searches. So, we split this out. We clean up the
11:05:23
data. We filter for only Best Buy URLs as well as ones that are for product. Then, we scrape each of those because,
11:05:29
as we saw, some of those URLs were just offline. We go to the AI agent. If it can't find that URL, it's going to just
11:05:35
give us $0 for it. We filter out the $0. Uh, we take our perplexity results. We
11:05:42
just grab what we want, which I could have just simplified the output, but that's fine. We merge these together by position because we do iPhone first,
11:05:48
then Android off of there. We put a summarize so that way we throw everything into the AI agent at once.
11:05:54
Turns multiple items into one. And we have our AI agent right over there. Obviously, like we could have other
11:05:59
areas where we want to print this out at and things like that. But I think this is a well enough example for you
11:06:06
guys. And that just became way more complicated than I wanted it to be. Damn, that Best Buy API. And it was a
11:06:13
good refresher on firecrop because I'm literally going to be recording section 15 now. I wanted to get the AI agent
11:06:20
stuff out of the way, but guess I'll be going backwards at doing that. Either way, if you were able to follow along
11:06:25
and you understood like 70 or 80% of this, you are doing a fantastic job. If
11:06:32
not, I apologize for kind of rambling through this, but I felt like it'd be a kind of a good idea to show you guys
11:06:37
like sometimes you're going to have to pivot in workflows even if you have an idea in your head. And uh I think this series is going to help me on that side
11:06:44
of things, at least presents it in a way that you guys can understand. All right. Uh next section is going to cover I want
11:06:50
to say chat hub. So we'll jump into that. So this part of the course we're going to be talking about a relatively
11:06:56
new feature that N rolled out which is going to be chatub. You can think of chatub as your interface kind of like
11:07:02
with chat GPT but just for nan the best part is we can change different models.
11:07:07
So we don't necessarily are tied to like let's say for example GPT5 maybe you're watching this future 6 or whatever else
11:07:13
is out but we can switch the models. So we can go from GPT to Sonnet to Gemini, whatever we want as long as we authorize
11:07:21
it. Another really great benefit is Cathub has enabled us to have different levels of users. We can now have users
11:07:27
that interact with our flows but cannot access them and this is in one place.
11:07:33
They can just talk back and forth uh conversationally with that workflow. There's some nuances that you're going
11:07:39
to have to know to set this up properly, but I want to go into the UI, explain everything, and yeah, let's jump right
11:07:46
into it. All right, so I just have a blank canvas over here, but what we're going to do
11:07:53
first is we're going to actually show you where ChatHub is. You might remember this pretty early on in the course, and
11:07:58
if you didn't, no worries. You can see it over here. If we go to the left, it says chat beta. I'm just going to
11:08:04
control-click it to open up in a new screen because we are going to be building out a workflow over here or multiple workflows in in that case. And
11:08:12
what you'll see is we have this chat hub over here. We have a new chat that we could have. We have personal agents. We
11:08:19
have workflow agents. You can see also some of my older chats that I had over here. These were essentially basic for
11:08:27
my uh initial ChatHub video. We're going to be building out brand new stuff as I mentioned for this particular video. And
11:08:34
then you can go back over here and go into settings as well. But this shows you all the settings, right? So you
11:08:39
would have to go to chat settings which we're going to cover here in a second as well. Uh but just going over here, you know, you can have a normal conversation
11:08:46
like you would have with the chat GPT. So first thing to notice is if you go to the top left over here, you'll notice
11:08:52
that I have kind of a robot emoji. That means I'm on a workflow agent. I can go
11:08:58
over here. If I go to a personal agent, you'll see it has this icon which just said chat and this is one that I built
11:09:04
out for SQL queries. And then if I want to go to a specific model, let's say I want to go to OpenAI and I want to use
11:09:12
uh we'll go over here and say GPT5 Mini will actually have the logo of the particular platform. So I could see this
11:09:18
tripping up people where you think you're actually talking to a specific model and you're talking to a personal agent or a workflow agent. So, make sure
11:09:25
that you choose your model as required. You can see also, let's say I want to go over here and go to Gemini,
11:09:32
Gemini Pro Preview. You can see it has the Gemini logo. I want to go to anthropic. Let's say I want to use a
11:09:39
Sonet 45. You can see it changes to the the logo. So, let's just test something out here in the chat. I believe I have
11:09:46
all these set up. If not, I'll just show you how to set this up really quickly. I'm going just going to ask in general
11:09:53
what were the different guitarists? What were the different
11:10:00
guitarists? Man, I can't spell today. In the band
11:10:06
Red Hot Chili Peppers, I want to say they've had like three or four guitarists. And uh you can see we have
11:10:15
our conversation and this looks very very similar into
11:10:21
our our interface over here. So uh it says red hot chili peppers had several guitarists throughout their history.
11:10:27
Main guitarist over here original guitarist and co-founder played on the albums for here. He tragically died over
11:10:34
there. Uh John obviously the guitarist that just recently came back. talked
11:10:41
about that. Dave Navaro gains addiction about that over there. And then Joshua,
11:10:46
he now plays curled man. You can see early brief members also brought up over
11:10:51
here. And I think I said there was four guitars. That's pretty spot on. And uh yeah, so we have all this information.
11:10:58
Now, if I wanted to change this chat and go over here and let's use OpenAI this
11:11:03
time. Use OpenAI Mini. What's
11:11:08
or say who are all the different drummers
11:11:16
tribute? And this might actually get it wrong because one of their recently drummers left, but we'll see what
11:11:22
happens. Over there, we have GPT5 Mini. You can see it's thinking right now and
11:11:28
uh we should be able to get a response assuming I already set this up. All right, so we have the drummers over
11:11:34
here and as I mentioned it would get it wrong. Alex Bent just left and they actually got another Alex in the band
11:11:40
but you have the original drummer and you have a bunch of replacements that happened over a few year period and then
11:11:46
you have Bent and uh yeah so you can see got it mostly correct except for the new
11:11:52
information which was kind of expected. One of the things with these models, and we talked about it in our section, is
11:11:58
they don't do a great job of getting up-to-date information. You're going to have to supplement it in some sort of
11:12:04
capacity. So, this kind of just shows you that side of things. Now, let's we can continue to do chats like this and
11:12:10
change the models. Um, as you can see also in this chat, one really cool thing I forgot to bring up, we started the
11:12:17
chat in Sunonnet 45 and we switched over to GPT4 or GPT5 mini. So, what's really
11:12:23
cool is you can switch models directly here in the chat. You don't have to create new chats. And I just think
11:12:29
that's really just an added benefit. Now, let's talk about personal agents. So, I'm going to create a new agent over
11:12:35
here. You can actually prompt uh an agent. You can set an icon in name,
11:12:41
enter in a description, uh specify a specific model. So, let's say I would just want to use Sonnet 45 with this
11:12:48
agent. You can also add in tools depending on the model. So let's think
11:12:53
of something on the fly. Uh my last video I did one particularly about uh
11:12:59
BigQuery and metabase SQL. Know my full-time job I do write a lot of Redshift SQL. Not to access my an
11:13:06
instance here, but let's go and build out something for a Redshift SQL debugger. So first we can change our
11:13:13
icon. We can choose whatever we want. I'm just going to give me a check mark over here. And I'm gonna say red shift
11:13:20
SQL debugger. And uh we can enter in a description. So
11:13:26
this and actually I said enter agent description. So I say this agent helps
11:13:34
debug red shift SQL. And by the way if you're watching this you're like why are you making another SQL um agent? Well,
11:13:41
the thing is with SQL probably 80 to 90% is the same language language, but there's just some weird quirks and
11:13:47
things like that. So sometimes you just need to define what SQL you're writing in. All right, so you are a debugger
11:13:56
or writer that solely focuses
11:14:02
on writing red shift SQL.
11:14:07
no other SQL variations.
11:14:13
Now, you would want to choose the model that you think would perform best on this task. Honestly, I've I've used a
11:14:18
lot of the cloud models for coding and I do like using Sonnet over there. And
11:14:23
then you can also add in tools. So, we can add in tools that are available to us. There's only two available tools
11:14:30
right now. So, it says use SER API to search the web for relevant information. So, we could actually do that. In fact,
11:14:35
I actually have a video or my first HTTP video, we talked about SER API. Here's
11:14:41
the deal though. This isn't really going to help with coding. And then we have GINA AI for web relevant information. So
11:14:47
when I talked about we weren't getting up-to-date information. Well, these tools would supplement it. So if I use SER API and that trivia search, it would
11:14:55
tell me that Alex Ben left the band a few months ago and they added a new drummer. Um, so you can create these
11:15:00
credentials over here and this allows us for a Google search. If we set this on and obviously like we need to choose our
11:15:07
SER API and choose that and actually let's probably do this as a second version. I'll just show you how to do
11:15:12
that here in a second. So I'm not going to set that up. I'm just going to say cancel. And this is one without a tool.
11:15:18
So you click save and then you can see now we have this icon so it stands out
11:15:23
as a personal agent. And then it just knows like hey I want to debug or write
11:15:29
shift SQL. I don't have to put that context in here in the conversations. So normally when I debug I'm have to paste
11:15:36
in code. I'm also going to say hey this is redshift SQL only write in red shift SQL. I don't have to do that every single time because I already put in
11:15:43
this as a system prompt and that should be very familiar with you because we just talked about that in the last lecture. So it's really cool that we can
11:15:49
put in a system prompt over here. This has been around for a while by the way. This isn't anything brand new but it's a
11:15:55
nice addition into any end. Let's create one new agent as well. And I'm going to say up-to-date news. Up to date.
11:16:06
Let's just change an icon. What icon are we going to use? Let's use like the DM icon. It does not matter.
11:16:13
Use this agent if we want up toate news. All right. And then we're
11:16:21
going to put you are a research
11:16:27
assistant. Use the SER API
11:16:33
when you need to search
11:16:39
your information. Obviously, this is a terrible prompt.
11:16:45
And this time, let's use Gemini. So, we're going to go over here. Actually, let's go back and use OpenAI GPT5 Mini
11:16:52
because we used that earlier. We're going to set up a tool. We're going to use SER API account. And I'm gonna use
11:16:58
this over here. Um, you would obviously want to set up your SER API account. It's honestly really, really easy. Like,
11:17:05
go to SER API. Let me just show you this really fast. Go to SER API,
11:17:11
register, and literally on the front screen, it's going to give you your API key. Like, I kid you not, it takes you
11:17:17
like two seconds to go over here. I already have mine, but you would want to register. I honestly just signed in with
11:17:23
Google. gonna give the API key and you're gonna have to set that up. Um, all right. So, I'm just showing you this
11:17:29
really fast. You don't have to follow every single step. I just want to show you really quick with tools. I do think there's going to be a lot more tools in
11:17:35
the future, but right now, like probably a week or two weeks after this is released, there's only two tools. So,
11:17:40
I'm going to click confirm. Your researcher use SER API tool. You need to search information.
11:17:47
I might actually rewrite this. your research assistant. Use SER API tool
11:17:52
to find the latest information or a query that someone writes.
11:18:01
My only concern was if I put that trivia question again, it's not going to register uh that it should use the tool.
11:18:08
So, I'm going to click save. Hopefully, I have some credits on there. I think I do. And then we're going to literally
11:18:13
ask the same question. So, who are all the different drummers for Trivia? This could fail. uh this might not fail. So,
11:18:20
let me show you also how we can get to the here. Let's imagine you're at a new chat. So, instead of going over here and
11:18:25
hey, I want to go take a look at this up-to-date news. I'm going to go new chat, go over here to personal agents,
11:18:30
and I'm going to click update news. And you can see it changes. And you can see we have one tool attached over here. So,
11:18:38
let's try it out. So, who are all the different terms for Trivia again? Hopefully, I have some SER API
11:18:44
credits. I probably do not, and that's why it went wrong. All right, let's try it again.
11:18:50
Nope, I don't have any SER API credits. I never paid for the tool, so um minus the one HTTP video, but you're going to
11:18:56
have to trust me on this one that essentially what happens is it would search. I would go scrape Google, find
11:19:03
the information, and it would tell us what it is. Let me just try one other thing. Let's try a different model just
11:19:11
in case. Like 99% sure I'm just out of credits. Um, maybe I'll just double check that. But I don't want to pay for
11:19:17
extra credits because I only just used it for a demo API video. All right, let's just use Sonnet and see if we get
11:19:24
that. Nope. So, something wrong. That's all right. But you understand now the basics behind personal agents. You
11:19:30
essentially were able to add in a prompt. You can also add in a tool as necessary. You can see I've added insert
11:19:35
API over there. Just make sure that you have credits for these tools, otherwise you're going to have the error that I have over there. All right, so that's
11:19:43
pretty easy. Next, let me just show you. If you want to delete a tool as well, you can just go over here, right click that, and
11:19:50
click delete. I don't want to have this here anymore. Boom. It's been deleted, and now it is gone from your personal
11:19:55
agents. So, the other side, which is pretty cool, is going to be your workflow agents. So, essentially, what
11:20:00
you can do on this side of things is actually chat with your workflows. You're going to have to need a few
11:20:05
different things though to make that available for you. We're actually just going to build one workflow together.
11:20:12
We'll throw it in over here on that side of things. So, we'll cover that here in a second. Um, let me also show you
11:20:19
really fast some of the different settings behind ChatHub because I do think it is important. So, if we go to
11:20:24
settings and we go into chat, here's the different models that you can make available. So, first thing you're going
11:20:30
to do is click on these three dots and you can click edit provider. And what you want to do for chat hub is enable
11:20:37
the different large language models. So you can see I enabled Open AI. Next, you choose the credential. So this is your
11:20:44
account that we set up a little bit earlier in the course. And then if you want to limit models in any capacity,
11:20:49
you can click over here. And then you can choose what model uh you want to specifically use. So let's say if you
11:20:56
set this up, you only are allowed to use GPT40 latest. Um I'm not going to limit it. I'll just let people choose whatever
11:21:03
they specifically want. And then you can see last edited just now. All these other ones I haven't updated as of yet,
11:21:08
but you can just go in here and it literally takes two seconds to do that. Other thing as well is you have a users section. So what's pretty cool is you
11:21:16
can actually invite users just to see chat. So if I click over here, invite, and you go into RO, you can see that
11:21:22
there's something called a chat user. So what a chat user only allows them to do is access chat hub. They cannot access
11:21:29
your specific workflows. So you can think of this in the data governance side of things. Let's say you're a tech
11:21:34
lead or a data scientist for a specific team and you build out all these tools that you just don't want people to
11:21:40
access the actual workflow behind it. You just want them to be able to write to that workflow. Well, that is where
11:21:47
having a chat user helps. Like you can invite a lot of people. Let's say for my full-time job, I do the data for our
11:21:54
risk and underwriting team. We probably have, I don't know, 25 different people in the department. I don't want all of
11:21:59
them to have access to my workflows. So I'll make them chat users and then they can interact with those workflows as
11:22:05
specifically required. All right. So I'm going to go back to chat hub now and we're actually going to build out a
11:22:10
workflow agent. So we're actually going to have to start on this side of things and we're going to build our first step.
11:22:17
And because it's literally chat, you know, it should be pretty common sense what we're going to start with. So we go
11:22:22
over here and we say chat trigger. And this is going to start our workflow. The
11:22:27
next thing to know is no matter what in your workflow, whether you only have a
11:22:32
chat trigger and an AI agent or you have a full workflow, you have to respond
11:22:37
back with an AI agent. So, pretty important on here. So, if I go to AI agent and the setting that you have to
11:22:44
do is if you go over here and you choose enable streaming, this has to be on. If
11:22:51
that is not on, your workflow will not work. So, make sure that you enable streaming on your AI agent. It is super
11:22:58
important. Again, it doesn't matter if it's like right here or if it's like way down here and you have 10 nodes before
11:23:03
your AI agent. Make sure that you enable streaming. Otherwise, it's not going to
11:23:08
work. In addition, to have a workflow populate in the workflow agents, you
11:23:14
have to publish your workflow. So, you're going to have to go through the process and publish it over here uh to
11:23:20
make it available. Otherwise, that will not be there. Uh going in over here also for this chat trigger you'll notice it
11:23:27
says make chat publicly available but then you also have make available in nan chat. So it says whether to make the
11:23:34
agent available in n chat. You have to make this and it says your end users will be able to use this agent in chat
11:23:40
once this workflow is published. Make sure to share this workflow with at least project chat user access to all
11:23:45
users use it. Currently only streaming response mode is supported. So again with streaming take a look enable
11:23:51
streaming. So, please set that up. It's super easy to do within our AI agent.
11:23:56
We're just going to build out our very basic prototype. We're going to just have this chat trigger go straight into this AI agent. So, just set that up over
11:24:03
here and then add in a chat model. Um, what we're going to do is we can add
11:24:10
whatever. I'm going to use Gemini this time. So, I'll just use Gemini. We'll go over here to Gemini account one.
11:24:17
Actually, it's my Gemini account 3, I believe, is the correct one. Uh, we're going to go into three. So, group 3 pro
11:24:23
preview. Well, so that's there. I'm going to save that. And um, you know, I
11:24:29
haven't really changed anything at all. I should probably add in a system message. And what are we going to
11:24:34
actually try to solve on this side of things? You know, I haven't I didn't even think about this when we're building this out. Um, actually, it
11:24:41
doesn't matter. Let's just test this out. We're going to save this. We're going to publish this.
11:24:47
We should version this. Obviously, I would want to write things out. Version one, Gemini tests and uh test for live
11:24:56
video. Got it. So, obviously we are live right
11:25:05
now. I would recommend that you test this in here first before you actually publish this. And I'm just going to
11:25:11
click over here and open chat. Then let's ask it a particular question.
11:25:18
Um, what I'm going to ask over here is what is the most valuable basketball
11:25:26
card in 1961 Fleer? And again, just a stupid question, but
11:25:34
it should be a Will Chamberlain and we'll get the exact results here. I'm curious if it actually gives us like an
11:25:39
auction price or just as the exact card. So, I could see both. They'll say this
11:25:45
the Wilt Chamberlain and then it'll tell us some of the auction sales. But we'll see. Again, just make sure before you
11:25:50
actually test in the chatub you have that. And look at that. Without a question, Wilt Chamberlain
11:26:00
PSA 9 have sold for 600 to 700,000. That is correct. Runner up, Oscar Robertson,
11:26:06
Jerry West, and Elgen Baylor. That is also correct over here.
11:26:12
All right. Great. So, we're going to test this out now in ChatHub. So, again, we made sure that this is available in
11:26:18
Cathub. We published our workflow and our AI agent is streaming. So, those are the three things you're going to have to do. We're going to go over here and
11:26:25
we're going to just refresh this. Should be available now. Cool. You can see section 17, ChatHub is
11:26:32
available on here. Now, I didn't add in a description. You can actually add in your description as well for your
11:26:37
specific workflow. I didn't do that, but you can see this populates over here. Let me just show you really fast how we can add a description. So, click these
11:26:44
three dots, edit description, and I'm just going to say basic
11:26:50
tutorial showing chat hub like that. Again, nothing like too spectacular. I
11:26:56
would recommend that you actually write a detailed description for your users that are doing this. Also, one of the things I would recommend to I'm going to
11:27:03
have to republish this and save it for it to show, but that's all right. Obvious if you go over here, you can see edit description that's over here.
11:27:09
Another thing I would recommend you do is even outside of any end, write some documentation on how things like work,
11:27:15
like what type of prompts you're expecting to come in because obviously this is pretty open-ended right now.
11:27:20
Like people can write whatever they want and I don't always recommend that especially if you're trying to get great
11:27:27
results. So I'd build out some sort of template outside like these are prompts I would expect to have over here um just
11:27:32
so that things work properly. Anyways, and we're going to ask over here what is the most valuable? Let's go. What is the
11:27:41
most valuable card in 1961 Fleer basketball
11:27:48
that is not a rookie card? All those are rookie cards. Um so, uh it's going to be
11:27:54
a Celtics player if you know vintage basketball, but we'll get the exact results over here in a second.
11:28:02
Let that run and you can see it's going to go into our chat hub. I'll show you some other pretty cool things here in a second once we get the actual answer.
11:28:09
And again, you can see like I didn't define a model. All I'm defining is that specific workflow right over here. And
11:28:14
it's going to get me that exact result. Show you where you can find this in your chat as well here in a second once this
11:28:20
loads. That might take a little bit, but most valuable card 61 that is not a
11:28:26
rookie card is Bill Russell Celtics. There you go. U so there's that one. Paul Aerin over there. Um technically
11:28:34
not a rookie. Caveat will Chamberlain. It's amazing. It knows that because some people will argue that it's a rookie.
11:28:40
Some people will not argue that it is not a rookie card. So, um I love that
11:28:45
over here. Gemini is such a great model because it even knows the nuances of vintage card collecting, which is a
11:28:50
very, very small niche of collectors out there that will argue about this. But,
11:28:56
uh yeah, that's pretty amazing. Oh, we got this correct over here on that side of things. So actually if you want to
11:29:02
test this out and you're like hey this might bug like where can I see what's going on. If you go to executions take a
11:29:08
look at this. So we know this is coming from chatub and you'll see it says when chat message received it goes into the
11:29:15
agent. So our chat message the most valuable card that is not a rookie card. And then we have our AI agent over here.
11:29:20
You know, I didn't bring this up to the N team when we talked about ChatHub, but I do think it would be kind of interesting if there was like an icon
11:29:26
over here that just mentioned that this was coming from ChatHub just to quickly see this because I can see people
11:29:32
testing this directly in here or going ChatHub. So, maybe an icon would be kind
11:29:37
of nice maybe in the future. I'll I'll bring it up next time I talk to them. Um, so again, this is like the very
11:29:43
basic prototype. So, I'm going to pause the video really quick on my side of
11:29:48
things. I want to build out another workflow within this chat hub. We're actually going to just probably make a a
11:29:54
V2 over here for section 17. Both will be in the school group. And I just want to show you like what happens if you
11:29:59
have a chat trigger, multiple nodes, and then another chat trigger or not chat trigger, but AI agent at the very end
11:30:06
just to respond because it is slightly different. Um, so really quick, just before I pause to show you, oh, if we
11:30:14
want to get into a workflow agent, just click this over here, workflow agents, and then you can see I go over here to
11:30:19
section 17, chat hub, and now we're directly in workflow agent. You can either go over here and start with that, or you can go into a new chat and uh,
11:30:26
just go to workflow agents like that, and go into chatub. And, uh, I think there was one other thing I just wanted
11:30:32
to show really fast. Me go back to new for here, workflow agents. So you can see when we write a description, we
11:30:39
actually have the information about it. See it says generate a video from text. Again, I have to republish this if I
11:30:44
want to make that work correctly. But we'll think of a example chat message, multiple nodes, and then a AI agent here
11:30:51
at the very end. I'm just going to pause, think about it, and I'll be right back. All right, so let's uh build out
11:30:57
our second workflow. I'm just go over here and call this section part two and let's get going. So, I
11:31:06
thought of an idea. This isn't the best idea as well for chat hub, but it will
11:31:11
kind of get you used to it. So, essentially what we're going to do and make a sticky note to explain. We're
11:31:17
going to get a chat. So, we'll get a message. Then, what I want to do is uh learn
11:31:24
about that message about the message. We're going to do that through an AI
11:31:29
agent. I'm going to show you guys a little bit later actually some other nodes that you could utilize that
11:31:37
oh but for now since I haven't taught you about those we're just going to use a blank AI agent. Then we're going to go
11:31:45
and get an RSS feed based off of the company someone wants to research bas
11:31:50
recent news around. We're going to limit those results because RSS feeds can give
11:31:55
you a lot of results. Then what we're going to do is summarize the results
11:32:01
so that way we have all the items in one thing and finally send the AI agent
11:32:06
which then goes back to chat. So as I mentioned like there's way better ways
11:32:12
that we could do this with like rag and really build out some advanced workflows with other AI nodes but since I haven't
11:32:19
taught you guys that yet maybe we can explore this a little bit later on in the course. So let's do this one. So,
11:32:25
first thing what I'm going to do is set up a chat trigger. And we'll grab that over here. And we'll
11:32:32
want to make this chat available in any end chat. And uh we have that over here.
11:32:38
Again, you can put a name and a description over here. I think I skipped this step a little bit earlier. So, I
11:32:44
apologize on this. We'll say like RSS researcher for news
11:32:50
researches RSS feed. for you. All right. So, we have
11:32:56
something like that. Okay. The next step, what we're going to do is build out an AI agent. So, what we're going to
11:33:03
do in inside our AI agent first is we have this connected to chat. So, we're good there. We're going to add in a chat
11:33:08
model. So, let's add in anthropic on the side of things. I'm just going to use Sonnet 45. Right. Then, what I want to
11:33:15
do is uh go and add option. And I want to go over here.
11:33:22
Sorry, not add option, but I want to require a specific output format. And what we're going to do is add in a
11:33:28
structured output parser. All right. So, what we're going to have in over here, we're just going to remove this last
11:33:34
one. And then I'm going to go over here and call this RSS URL. So, RSS URL. And
11:33:41
then I'm just going to put over here example.com RSS. So essentially what we're going to
11:33:48
do with our AI agent now is we're going to go and add in a system message. Now I already practiced this for you guys. So
11:33:55
I'm just going to type this out or sorry paste this over here and I'm just going to say a user will ask about the latest
11:34:01
news about a company. I want you to research the RSS feed for a company and give me me the URL to use only output
11:34:07
the URL. So essentially if I know a website has an RSS feed, they're going to constantly post news about it. I
11:34:13
don't want to have someone research that RSS URL and spend time. This is going to automatically give me that RSS. So
11:34:20
hopefully that makes sense. Obviously, you can build this out way better. I'm just making a very quick uh section of a
11:34:26
very long YouTube video. All right, so we have that. Next thing we're going to do is add in RSS. So we're going to go
11:34:33
RSS read. And what we're going to have to do is pass in that specific URL. So,
11:34:38
I'm just going to test this out and I'm just going to say Open AI or something like that. So, what I'll do is first
11:34:45
disconnect this and I'll say open AI. It'll go through here and it
11:34:54
will get me that specific RSS URL. And you can see we have RSS XML like that,
11:35:00
which I believe this is the correct one. I'm just going to pin this for testing purposes and uh just go over here and
11:35:07
grab that. So, grab the RSS URL. You can see 793 items. Perfect.
11:35:14
Obviously, we don't want to send 793 items to our next AI agent. So, what I'm going to do is do a limit. So, we're
11:35:20
going to go over here to limit. I'm going to set the max items of five. Obviously, you can change that as you
11:35:26
want. And you'll see now we only have five items. We have all this in a table. Title, link, publish date, etc. Content
11:35:33
snippet, good, ISO date. Great. Cool. So, next section, what we're going to do
11:35:38
is add all of these items together. And again, I I told you a little bit earlier
11:35:44
in the course. I like using summarize because I feel it gives us a lot more customization options to it. So, I'm
11:35:52
going to go into concatenate. What we're going to concatenate is the content itself. So, we're going to throw
11:35:57
content over here. And then I'm gonna add in actually a custom separator. So
11:36:02
I'm going to do slashn for new line. Then I'm going to spam this a little bit and I'm gonna say slashn just to let it
11:36:08
know like hey these are new sections slashn slashn. Right. So if I execute this step now you'll see we have this
11:36:16
big text block. This is a part of an article or content. This is part of an article. And actually I should probably
11:36:21
put a space here at the end just so that way it doesn't
11:36:26
take up too much. Let's execute the step. Good. Now you can see it's a little bit more readable. Um, and you
11:36:32
can see where we have these new lines and that is working correctly. Perfect. So now like we have one, two, three,
11:36:41
four, five. Right? So that's the point. Now we're going to send all this back into an AI agent. So I'm going to go
11:36:46
into our AI agents and uh, now we have to change a few things up. So, first thing we're gonna
11:36:52
have to change up is we're gonna define below and let me grab what I put for the
11:36:58
prompt over here. So, I wrote a very very basic prompt again like don't do this in a
11:37:04
production. I said based on the content provide a two to three sentence summary based on what is going on with recent news. And there's better AI nodes out
11:37:11
there as well for summarization. We're covering that a little bit later on. So, what we're going to do is just drag and
11:37:16
drop this over here. I would just recommend making this an expression first. Then drag and drop that in. Cool.
11:37:22
So we have this. And I'm just going to say contents like that. Perfect. So let me save that.
11:37:31
We also need to attach a chat model. I'm just going to go open AI this time.
11:37:36
It's fine for summarization. I'm going to go to my specific accounts and grab GPT5 mini. Obviously change the model as
11:37:44
you specifically want. And we have one more thing we need to go over here and do. If you go over here and look for
11:37:50
streaming. So you need to enable streaming and then perfect. So I just want to test this out really quick. So
11:37:56
based on the content provided to three sentence summary. Perfect. All right. We'll execute the step.
11:38:04
Just testing this out. Create. And there we go. Enterprise adoption. Canva modern
11:38:12
PayPal Virgin Atlantic. BBBA Cisco. US government. Cool.
11:38:18
all that information over there. Great. So now what we need to do is publish this workflow and unpin our data. So
11:38:24
first unpin our data on that side of things. We're going to click save. So no
11:38:29
no data is pinned. So we're looking good there. We're going to publish this. I'm going to say version one RSS
11:38:37
AI and we're just going to say added in streaming. I don't know. It doesn't matter. Write write your changes over
11:38:43
here. Obviously, for a change log, it's it's actually important, but um this is for just a quick video. Cool. So, we
11:38:50
have all of this built in over here. And what we need to do is now go back
11:38:55
into our chat. We're going to go into our workflow agents. And you can see our ISS researcher news is over here. So,
11:39:02
I'm literally just going to type in a website. Let's go an example and do OpenAI. So, Open AI
11:39:10
and it should now run that specific workflow. And we actually got an error.
11:39:15
That is interesting. So I'm going to pause that and we're actually going to debug this here in a second. All right.
11:39:21
So let's take a look at what happened. So I have our executions over here.
11:39:28
So we sent in the message as open AI and I have a user asked about the latest
11:39:34
news about a company. I want you to research RSS feed. Only output the URL. I need to actually define this a little
11:39:40
bit better. Also, I apologize if you hear the dog in the background. Um, user will ask you latest, I want you to
11:39:46
research RSS feed and give me the RSS URL to use only output the RSS URL.
11:39:58
For example, if someone s searches
11:40:05
or asks about Microsoft and I'm just going to search Microsoft RSS really
11:40:11
quick. Microsoft RSS URL.
11:40:20
I'm probably going to go into Perplexity and search that.
11:40:29
What is the RSS URL? Microsoft. And I know it's on my other screen. I'm just
11:40:34
going to show you guys this in a second. Cool. We have this over here. Okay.
11:40:39
Let's just say Microsoft AIF RSS feed URL. I'm sure there's one over here.
11:40:49
Great. So, we have that URL. I'm going to paste this over here.
11:40:55
Microsoft AI Let's try this a second time. Cool. So,
11:41:01
we'll save that and we'll go back over here and try this again. So, go to new
11:41:07
chat again. This is why you build out and test a lot more than just once, but that's perfectly fine. All right. So,
11:41:14
we're going to go into our RSS researcher news. I'll say latest news
11:41:20
open AI. And hopefully this goes through the entire workflow.
11:41:30
All right. So, we're having errors there again. I'm just going to stop this really fast. I'm going to remove that
11:41:37
test one more time. And you know what? I need to republish
11:41:44
this as well. So, we're just going to say v2 because the changes I made in here
11:41:50
aren't going to be applicable on that side of things. All right, we're going to try this again.
11:41:57
And I'm just going to say latest news open AAI
11:42:04
now. It looks like it's actually working. And I'm actually kind of glad that I have some errors so that way we
11:42:11
can test this out. All right, so OpenAI says more than 1 million customers. Great. So now let's try something else.
11:42:17
We'll say latest news anthropic.
11:42:23
Let's see if we can get something with entropic.
11:42:29
Please try again. All right. So now let's go back into our executions. Let's see what happened over here. What is our
11:42:34
error on this side of things? We actually got a bad URL. So you can see it says that is the URL for
11:42:42
Enthropic. However, that is not correct. And maybe they don't have RSS feed. Um,
11:42:47
all right. Let's take a look at another one. Maybe Perplexity has one. So, we'll go latest news Perplexity. Again, I I
11:42:54
know this wasn't the best example, and I've told you guys this a few times, but we'll do latest news perplexity. See if
11:43:00
it works. I assume it's the same thing with Perplexity.
11:43:08
D code 403. All right. So, we're not actually getting the RSS URLs. Uh, let's look up
11:43:16
what are some other RSS URLs for AI news.
11:43:24
And, uh, just going to search this really fast.
11:43:29
All right, we're going to look up something over here and say uh, AI models FYI. That's one
11:43:38
possibly. Hold on. I'm trying to find another good one. Oh, business insider might be interesting.
11:43:45
Let's do business insider. We'll go latest
11:43:51
business insider. All right. And if this doesn't work, you
11:43:57
know, I'll have to change some stuff. But, uh, hopefully this example works. Knock on
11:44:04
wood. There we go. So obviously like this needs a lot of work just based off
11:44:10
of the prompting if there's an RSS feed or not like sending some message back that there is none. But you can see in
11:44:16
this workflow um it worked properly. You can see we have our chat message goes to our AI agent. AI agent finds the RSS for
11:44:23
business insider RSS over here. It gives us 20 new articles and then we have the updates
11:44:30
over there. Um we can try one more. Let's do Crunch Base. So, we go latest
11:44:36
news. Crunch base. News. Crunch base.
11:44:44
That should be fine. Try it out. I see it as a subdomain, at least on this RSS
11:44:50
list I'm looking at. So, I don't know if it'll work correctly or not. Again, that'd be something I'd probably put in the prompt if it doesn't.
11:44:58
There we go. Awesome. So that is a chat hub.
11:45:04
Essentially, if you want to have an AI agent start, I would recommend you have a chat message, AI
11:45:11
agent or another node, which I'll show you shortly, processes, what's in that message. Then you build out a very basic
11:45:17
workflow. I just shown you RSS one as well as summarize and then go back into an AI agent. Just imagine that there's
11:45:24
streaming. Sorry. So just make sure that you enable streaming at the very end. So it goes back into chat hub again. In
11:45:31
chatub you have personal agents which you can define your own system prompt. You can add in tools. Right now there's
11:45:36
two tools but there will be more workflow agents work directly with your workflows that have a chat trigger and
11:45:42
then streaming available at the very end. Um you can go and use this kind of like chat GPT. You can go and choose a
11:45:49
model if you want or you can go over here and choose a personal agent which I talked about or your workflow agents.
11:45:56
And again you can choose different options based off of the security level of a person. So if you don't want them
11:46:01
accessing your workflows, you can just set them to chaton privilege. And that is chat hub. So next section we're going
11:46:08
to do is talk about testing and debugging strategies, which I guess we already looked at a little bit of the basics over here, but that was a little
11:46:14
bit of a warm preview for that. Uh keep up the awesome work. You know, uh we've
11:46:20
learned a lot so far in this course and hopefully you have really increase your A skills. All right, see you in the next
11:46:27
section. So this section is going to cover something pretty important. A lot of people will find it boring and um
11:46:33
know it's unfortunate but it is something that you need to understand to really take your workflows to the next
11:46:39
level and this is going to be error handling. So what happens if there is an
11:46:45
error in a workflow? Everyone thinks they can build out perfect workflows but the real world hits you. In reality
11:46:51
that's not the case. Like there's always going to be some sort of edge case. some API service is going to be down and
11:46:57
you're going to be stuck with an error. And you know, a lot of people that are on the amateur level will not build out
11:47:04
specific use cases for error handling. And it's important, really important.
11:47:09
Um, that's going to be one part of the video. Another one is going to be about debugging and really kind of thinking of
11:47:16
how can you fix an error that is going on in your workflow. We're also going to
11:47:21
cover some of the nodes and that can be helpful in debugging as well because
11:47:26
there's two sides of debugging, right? There's the debugging of your workflow not working but then um that goes into
11:47:33
errors but you also have the side of debugging where like you're not getting the correct results in some capacity. So
11:47:39
just wanted to share some nodes that might help over there show some strategies and we're going to combine
11:47:44
these together. So this is going to be our section on error handling as well as debugging. Hopefully you learn a few
11:47:50
things and hopefully it it really doesn't for you. Promise you after this we're going to go
11:47:56
into some really cool AI notes in the next lesson so that way you have some more exciting things to learn. Again, I
11:48:02
understand this is not everyone's favorite topic. So, let's jump into it.
11:48:08
First thing what we want to do is make some errors happen. And uh it'll be kind
11:48:13
of fun. So, what I'm going to do is do a manual trigger. And what we'll set up is an AI agent. So, just go over here, grab
11:48:20
our AI agent. You should be pretty familiar with how to set this up, and we're going to remove this chat trigger.
11:48:27
Let's remove that out of the way. And uh yeah, so what we're going to do
11:48:32
is go in over here. We're going to say define below. And the first thing what we're going to do is make an error
11:48:38
happen on purpose. Obviously, I don't have a chat model. I'm just going to run this workflow. And you'll see it says
11:48:44
problem executing workflow. There was a problem executing the workflow has issues and cannot be executed. the workflow has issues. Let's try running
11:48:51
it internally over here. And you'll see that there's issues. So, I'm going to just save this. If we go into our
11:48:57
executions, you'll see we also have errors over here. And uh yeah, it says
11:49:03
error in 23 milliseconds. And you'll see exactly where our error is at. Um this tells us we're in a test
11:49:10
execution. If we don't have this icon, we're in a normal execution in production. So, be wary of that. But
11:49:18
there's some ways to handle these errors here in a second. I just was going to show you like what happens. Now, by default, I think everyone knows like if
11:49:26
there is an error, your workflow will stop. But that's not always the case. We can actually change the way that we
11:49:33
approach this. So, we can actually continue forward. And it says execution will continue even if the node fails.
11:49:40
And you can see we have this icon over here. So, we can run this. And actually looks like we probably have another
11:49:45
error probably because we don't have a chat model in over here. Um but you can see we would be able to continue this
11:49:51
forward. Another option that we have is we can go and continue with an error
11:49:56
output. So what this allows us to do is have a second output. If our note is
11:50:01
success, we go in this way. If we have an error, we go into this path. And why
11:50:07
this is important? Well, you can set that second path to notify people on your team or notify yourself. You might
11:50:13
have that second path. Send an email to an IT administrator or send an email to
11:50:19
your AI engineer that's focused directly on building out your NA workflows. So
11:50:25
with an error, you have the three options. You can either stop the workflow, nothing happens. You could go
11:50:31
and continue the workflow even if a node fails or you could go into that specific
11:50:37
error output. Now the second part of it is what happens if there's a failure? Can we retry it? Well, you can. And you
11:50:44
can see that there's an option over here. It says retry on fail. So, if you click on that, you have a few different
11:50:50
settings. So, by default, it says you have three max retries. So, this tells you how many times you're going to retry
11:50:56
that particular node. Why this is helpful? If you're calling an API or you're using like some sort of AI agent,
11:51:03
sometimes the API service is going to be down. So, you might want to retry this again multiple times for it to work
11:51:09
properly. So, um, by default it's 1,000 milliseconds, which is 1 second. You can
11:51:15
change that. If you go over here, 2 seconds, 3 seconds, you get the point. The same with the retries. It doesn't
11:51:21
have to be three, it could be two, it could be four, it could be seven. You choose what you want. And these settings
11:51:28
can be in addition to what happens with the error. So, you can see this example over here. Um, we have retry on failure.
11:51:35
And then we go in here and say hey we want to actually continue even after we retry. So you see the icon has changed
11:51:43
if we want to continue error output again icon has changed as well. Um so
11:51:48
not icon but the ends have changed over here as well. So you have a few different options on the errors on that
11:51:54
side. Again this is by default you can uh stop workflow and doesn't retry on fill but if it's really important I
11:52:00
would just recommend that you change that. Uh, okay. So, we have that side
11:52:06
covered. The next thing what I want to talk about is the error node. And this
11:52:12
is pretty cool because if we go into this side over here, you'll see there's something called stop an error. So, let
11:52:18
me just say stop and error. So, whenever this node is called, there's going to be
11:52:24
an error message. So, you can see stop an error and it says an error occurred by default. We can say that. So, an
11:52:30
error occurred. And why this is helpful, you can see we have the red X. This is
11:52:37
what happens, by the way, if your workflow fails. When you go to executions, you'll see it over here. It says error.
11:52:44
You can see stop in error. This isn't set up correctly, which is why that has issues. This actually has an error. But
11:52:51
yeah, so you can specify what type of error message you want. I'm going to say
11:52:57
error occurred like this. You can see that has specifically changed. But why this is helpful? Let's
11:53:03
imagine you have some sort of logic in your workflow and you say anything that goes to this branch, this should never
11:53:08
happen. Well, and let me just show you that as example. Let's say we have an if statement or we could have a switch or
11:53:15
something like that. And you know, okay, all cases technically should be if, but just like there's this really weird edge
11:53:21
case that sometimes happens and if this happens, someone needs to know. Um, so let's go and run the stop and error. So
11:53:29
if this returns false, it has that specific error and obviously you can
11:53:34
build upon that error as you specifically want. But you have that
11:53:40
option over here to use it. So again in our AI agent we have the options to
11:53:46
retry and this is all nodes by the way just to show you it's not just a agent. If we go to edit sets we go to settings
11:53:54
you can see over here we have the option to retry on fail and and error. Right? So we have that option in both but we
11:54:03
have those settings to stop and handle errors. We also have a way to cause errors on purpose with the stop and
11:54:09
error. Again, very commonly used after an if node or a switch node.
11:54:15
And you know, obviously it depends on where you want to host this, but typically after some sort of logic like
11:54:22
this where you expect 99% of the cases to go in one direction, if it's something really weird, stop an air. But
11:54:29
let me also explain there's some other really cool things that you could build out with this because if you actually
11:54:36
have errors, you could send those errors to another workflow. So let me show you
11:54:42
this for example and we're just going to create a brand new workflow. I'm actually go over here workflow
11:54:49
create and personal and I'm just going to make this as like a part two. So what we have over here is
11:54:57
something called an error trigger. So it says triggers the workflow when another workflow has an error. So this is really
11:55:03
amazing because what happens? Let's imagine you have a larger workflow and
11:55:08
you have some sort of error. Well, you can send that error to this workflow and
11:55:14
this does all your error handling like hey you need to message this person it you need to log this into a spreadsheet.
11:55:21
It's really important. So like two concepts that you should know is like when you have an error what do you need
11:55:26
to do? Number one, you need to log your errors. So, I have a background in risk
11:55:32
and um it's really important if you have any sort of error that you need to log it. So, make sure log your errors. This
11:55:39
could be in a database, this could be a sheet like a document of any sort, but
11:55:46
you need to specify like when did you have an error? You need to keep control of that. The second is you need to let
11:55:53
people know. So, let people know. who should know like should the AI
11:55:58
engineer knowments
11:56:03
or should like it know but that's the two components of it and you can build out a workflow based around this like
11:56:08
this error trigger you could connect this into sheets or data tables and then you could like
11:56:16
add in a new row and let's imagine you had something that over here just solely
11:56:21
focused on errors. So you could add in new rows over there. Let's say you have a Slack channel. So you go into Slack.
11:56:27
And I haven't set up Slack on this instance. Um, but you could also make a message. So let's say
11:56:35
you want to create a channel based around it. You can send a message. Whatever the case is, send a message.
11:56:41
So you have an error. It gets sent over here and then you know it updates a row
11:56:47
in a spreadsheet and it lets someone know that something has happened. You could also send an email. So if you go
11:56:52
to Gmail, right, you can send an email as well and send a message and maybe you have all three. But it's just super
11:56:59
important that you log your errors, whatever the case that is. And then you let people know that something has
11:57:04
failed. Now, you might be wondering, it's like, okay, this is really cool, but how do we get an error in here to
11:57:11
start this workflow? So if you take a look at these three dots over here, and you go into settings, and what we have
11:57:18
next is our errors. So it says error workflow to notify when we have an error. You just go over here and choose
11:57:24
your specific workflow. So you can see I have an email newsletter error trigger over here and an and error handling part
11:57:30
three. So those were two that I've built out. I need to publish this if I wanted to specifically send my errors over
11:57:37
here. So make sure that you do that. I'm just going to close that out over there. Um so that's the other step, right? Make
11:57:43
sure you save this, you publish it, so then it will be available on that side of things. But yeah, that's all you got
11:57:50
to do. Click that and then when you have an error, it will populate over here and you can see your executions like, hey,
11:57:56
when did this specifically run and you can see that directly in over there. So, I think that's pretty much the basics of
11:58:03
error handling that I want to cover. I'm going to take a look at my notes and double check. Um, but we're going to
11:58:08
talk about debugging here in a second if I didn't forget anything. All right. I just want to also quickly show you what
11:58:14
the error looks like. So for example, you get the URL. It tells you what
11:58:19
description of the error is. You also see like what was sent over. This was an
11:58:25
error that I had with Nano Banana Pro that I had specifically. A lot more
11:58:31
other details associated with it. And this is what you would kind of break up and put within your spreadsheet. So you
11:58:39
can see, for example, this is kind of broken out. We can get the URL, the
11:58:44
description, the date which I would put as now and workflow name. Obviously, I
11:58:50
grabbed this from my other video which we already had this sort of built out for air handling and I have a full video
11:58:57
like I said covering air handling in more details if you want to learn just like everything else in uh this
11:59:02
particular video or I should say like 80% of it. But that is kind of the first
11:59:08
part of this video. The second part what I want to cover is essentially how do we
11:59:13
debug so
11:59:20
how do we debug workflows now first
11:59:26
thing I would probably recommend that you do for debugging is try to see if
11:59:33
you can solve it yourself. So, it seems self-explanatory, but number one, I'd
11:59:38
say try and solve first
11:59:47
if you can't figure it out. And there's ways to take a look at it. The second thing I would try to do is
11:59:55
grab the error and then a few screenshots and send it
12:00:00
to an LLM. So, how would that work?
12:00:07
Let's make an error on purpose. So, I'm going to go and
12:00:14
grab my uh example from one of the previous videos.
12:00:19
We'll just go all these workflows really quick. And I want to say it was in the web
12:00:25
scraping one. We had this. So, what I'm going to do is make an error on this
12:00:31
HTTP request on purpose. Let's say we have
12:00:37
Oh, yeah. We don't have an API key in here. So, this is going to be perfect. So, let me execute this step
12:00:44
and we're going to make an error happen. So, let me grab a manual trigger,
12:00:51
which it says I need only one manual trigger. That's fine. Just remove this here.
12:00:57
And we're gonna make error happen over here on purpose. So hopefully
12:01:05
we can test this out. All right. Oh, you know why? There is
12:01:15
to turn off this filter. So, by the way, if you want to test things out, you want to deactivate
12:01:20
things, we'll just go to the next node. Cool. This is going to air.
12:01:27
Great. So, take a look at this error that we have over here. It says forbidden apps. Check your credentials.
12:01:33
You're not subscribed to this API. Now, this is pretty basic. Like, it's saying that there's an issue with the API. And
12:01:39
this is pretty self-explanatory. Like, I don't have an API key. And you'll notice the same errors happen over and over
12:01:46
again. But, let me show you what we would do in this case. So, like imagine I don't know what's happening. I'm going
12:01:52
to go to Claude. And we're going to go over here, Claude. Let's
12:01:59
say what is my error my N any workflow
12:02:08
workflow and can you help solve it?
12:02:15
So, first I send the error message. So, you can see we have our error message. We have that over here. The next thing I
12:02:22
would do is try to get all the different settings. And I'm just going to close out some of these over here. I don't need that part too.
12:02:29
That's okay. Next, I would just scroll down. So, we have everything through the
12:02:35
JSON, I want to say. Or no, it's not through the JSON. We
12:02:41
have the first part over here missing. So, let's just take the other screenshots.
12:02:50
So we have two screenshots showing everything in these parameter section and I would also take a screenshot of
12:02:57
what's happening over here.
12:03:05
All right. So we have the three screenshots. We have the all the workflow and we have the different images inside. Let's see what happens.
12:03:18
looking at own workflow there is clear you're not subscribed to this API you
12:03:23
need active subscription so it's saying update your any end
12:03:29
credentials with the correct API key now obviously I do have a subscription but the hint is over here update your any
12:03:35
end credentials with the correct API key obviously I removed the API key here so
12:03:40
it's not working and that is the case right so pretty self-explanatory Okay,
12:03:48
additional issues in image one. Your headers show this looks truncated. Make
12:03:53
sure both your actual API key, not just X. So, obviously read through all of
12:03:58
this, but this was just one example and it's hard to replicate your exact error. But I can tell you from a lot of
12:04:04
debugging, like I'll recognize the same patterns over and over again. However, if I don't, I just send it to a
12:04:12
large language model. I use I like using Claude. put the screenshots in over here and let it go. And I also know through
12:04:20
MCP you could also test it with that and you could also
12:04:25
possibly upload JSON. I just find that this approach typically works best for
12:04:30
me. So that is what I use. And um one
12:04:36
other thing to note is if you're using APIs and I don't know if I talked about this in the API section or not.
12:04:41
Depending on the error code, it could be your fault or it could be someone else's fault. So if it's like a 500 error code,
12:04:49
that is the server's fault. That's not your fault and I wouldn't really worry about it. There's something else going on on that side of things. Another thing
12:04:57
is like how do you debug workflows when you get the wrong output? So,
12:05:03
I'm just going to say like errors. Now, how about like wrong output? Well, really when you get the wrong output
12:05:11
things I would recommend. So, number one, I would take a look at
12:05:17
your prompting to take a look how you prompt because chances are your prompt
12:05:25
is inefficient in some capacity and it's just not going to work. So, I'd take a
12:05:30
look at your prompt. There's probably something off or something that you could tweak in your prompt. Maybe you're getting a lot of hallucinations,
12:05:36
something in your prompt. Maybe you need to add in more context, etc. The second thing I would take a look at is your
12:05:43
data like is the data bad. And how how can we also test this? So,
12:05:49
few things that we can take a look at over here. You have a node called compare data sets. So, maybe you just
12:05:55
have a wrong data set. you have some issues within a data set, you could possibly compare it. Another thing you
12:06:03
could take a look at is duplicates. So, sometimes you don't want to have duplicates in your data set. So, I
12:06:11
didn't mean to click clear duplication history. Um, but I would test duplicates
12:06:16
as well. Like, you have some bad data with duplicates. Make sure to keep that in over here. We've already talked about
12:06:23
this, but for testing purposes, sometimes I want to limit and maybe I
12:06:29
don't want to send 10, 15, 20 items at a time. I just want to send in one item and see if I can get the correct results
12:06:35
or not. So these are three nodes that I've used before just for testing purposes and trying to debug. So compare
12:06:42
data set to see like if one data set matches the other, maybe you have an incorrect data set, not source of truth.
12:06:50
Remove duplicates. Duplicates are a big issue in a lot of different databases.
12:06:55
So maybe you're having duplicates and that's why you're having an issue in some capacity as well as the limit node
12:07:01
over here. So to kind of reiterate what is going on few things number one
12:07:09
lot of different settings within your nodes. You can retry on fail which I would highly recommend for critical
12:07:14
nodes. I would also possibly change on what happens with a specific error. you
12:07:19
have stop workflow, continue or pass. In addition, if you have workflows with you
12:07:26
know that 99.99% of the data should go in one path, but if it goes another path, there should be um alarm bells
12:07:33
raising. Use a stop and air with something like an if or a switch. How do
12:07:38
you debug workflows? In my opinion, the best way to learn is to try and solve it yourself. So, like try to see what is
12:07:44
going on, try to fix it. Um, one other thing I should mention is a lot of
12:07:49
people mess up with their merges. So, please double check what is in your
12:07:54
merge settings. I see so many people using the incorrect merge. And I've covered a decent amount in this video.
12:08:00
I've covered it a long time in another video. Make sure your merges are correct because that is one of the biggest
12:08:05
errors I see uh for people that reach out and I say, "Hey, my my workflow has errors. How can I fix it?" Oh, I see the
12:08:12
merge is incorrect. Um, another thing I see as well. So, and maybe I'll put this
12:08:18
over here as examples. Oops.
12:08:24
And we'll put this over here as examples. Like I see merge incorrect.
12:08:30
I see terrible bumps, which this includes like stuffing.
12:08:39
too much information or asking too many things
12:08:46
or not enough context. So I just want to be a little bit more explicit with you guys and explain why
12:08:55
let's say missing examples. Always when you provide examples you're going to get
12:09:00
better results. So spend some time and write that or the data is bad and you
12:09:05
can take a look at bad data. compare data set, row duplicates as well as limit. And that is going to be our
12:09:12
section on error handling. I know there's really not any um workflows for us to build together for this one. We
12:09:19
could do a a a debugging of a specific workflow. Uh but I think we were going
12:09:25
to probably do that another time. So, as promised, the next section is going to be more advanced AI agents and or not AI
12:09:32
agents, but advanced AI notes. And I think you're going to enjoy that one. So see you there. All right. So this next
12:09:37
section we're going to be focusing specifically on different types of AI nodes available in any and so far
12:09:44
throughout this course we've been solely focusing on AI agents and they're great because you can use them in a lot of
12:09:50
different use cases but typically it's not the best scenario. There's sometimes
12:09:55
that you want to use a basic LLM chain. There's some times you want to use information extractor. We're going to go
12:10:01
through all these different types of nodes. explain why you specifically want to use them. And like all of our other
12:10:07
sections, we'll cover some examples at the very end. So that way you have some practice using them in real workflows.
12:10:14
So let's not waste any time and jump right into it. All right. So first node
12:10:19
I want to cover over here is something called the basic LM chain. Now I also
12:10:25
want to show you where you can find these AI nodes because if you go over here, let's just trigger our workflow
12:10:30
manually for now. And you'll see that we have a section called AI. And we have a
12:10:35
ton of nodes. And obviously, we're not going to cover every single one of these today. But we're going to start off with
12:10:43
our basic LM chain. And jumping into our basic LM chain. Let's remove this chat
12:10:50
trigger. You'll notice it's very similar to our AI agent. If we click in over
12:10:55
here, uh connected chat trigger like we can set that up or you can define below. There's output format. There's a
12:11:01
fallback model. There's chat messages. If using a chat model, you have batch processing. Um, so very similar, but
12:11:09
you'll notice a few things are missing. Like even if we go over here, output fallback, which is great. We don't have
12:11:16
any tools. We don't have any memory. So this is essentially your dumbed down AI
12:11:23
agent. Well, it can perform a lot of the different tasks. you can't access tools and also you don't have access to memory
12:11:31
and there's nothing wrong with that because a lot of things we've covered so far in the course you know we just used
12:11:37
a model a fallback model if possible in output parser you don't need an AI agent
12:11:43
like everything in your AI agent is over here in your basic LM chain and again
12:11:48
you can just go over here and choose a model right great we'll use open AI over here um could you could choose whatever
12:11:56
model use specific one doesn't really matter. I'm blind right now and could not find open AI but you can see for
12:12:02
model or fallback model got an output parser. So you know starting this off
12:12:08
hopefully you already learned like we could simplify things. So if you see a basic LM chain right someone just
12:12:14
doesn't want to use a tool and that's why uh it's available for you. All right so next we're going to jump into uh
12:12:22
something called sentiment analysis. This is a little bit more fun. And again, we'll just jump into here
12:12:30
and uh we'll jump into sentiment analysis. So, very straightforward. You take a look at it. It says, is this
12:12:37
positive, negative, or neutral? And it asks you to add in a particular model.
12:12:43
So, we're just going to add in Open AI to save some money.
12:12:53
go over here, use GPT5 mini. So, not the best accuracy, but that's
12:12:59
all right. And let's just add in some text. And let's say you wasted
12:13:07
eight hours of my time. I have no idea, by the way, how long into the video uh
12:13:12
this is, but I'm recording in different sections, but feel like this is way over eight hours by now.
12:13:19
Uh we have here. Okay, that's interesting. We don't have any error here.
12:13:28
All right, let's use a for model just in case. Please
12:13:34
sit. We're going to get an error here as well.
12:13:42
And it worked this time. So, remember how we talk about fallback models?
12:13:48
So, I don't think you actually have a fallback model option. over here for the sentiment analysis.
12:13:54
We do not and I think this was something I did bring up to the NAN team on a call
12:14:00
like some of these other advanced nodes. They don't have fallback models yet. So if it did, this is a perfect example.
12:14:06
OpenAI failed and Anthropic came to the rescue on that side of
12:14:11
things. But you can see that you wasted eight hours of my time. It went into the negative branch because it just wasn't a
12:14:20
something positive, right? You can have positive, neutral, or negative. This was just straight up a negative. Let's do a
12:14:27
critique of the video. Awesome video. Awesome video.
12:14:32
However, after 10 minutes, I got bored. This might go into the
12:14:40
positive branch. It might go neutral. I think this should go neutral
12:14:46
if I was making a decision and uh it went into the neutral branch.
12:14:51
There's some positive aspects of it. The boredom that's negative. So it fit into the I'd
12:14:59
say thank you so much for dropping a uh 10 plus hour any end
12:15:07
video. That's my goal when I was recording this. I wanted to make this 10 to 15 hours
12:15:14
and uh we'll see what happens over here. You can see this get put into our
12:15:21
positive range. And what's great about it is you can actually build out
12:15:26
workflows based around it. So you could have a certain action if it goes to positive, a certain action if it goes to
12:15:33
neutral, or a certain action if it goes to negative. And you can think about this. You have a chatbot on your site
12:15:38
asking for feedback or email feedback goes through gets information goes
12:15:44
through sent analysis and then you build out different scenarios based off of positive, neutral or negative. Maybe it's negative. You give someone a coupon
12:15:51
and you have someone reach out and see like why this end up being a negative. Just trying to think on my feet like
12:15:57
some of the different ways that you could use this. There's tons of different ways. You could also scrape social media posts for a brand and see
12:16:04
like, okay, how many are positive? How many neutral? how many are negative. Let's reach out to these users that just had a negative experience or let's
12:16:11
reward the people that are talking positive about our brand online. Uh something very similar to sentiment
12:16:17
analysis. And by the way, I just want to quickly cover some of these properties over here. So you can actually change
12:16:22
your categories and you can add to these if you just put a comma. So you can see like added to
12:16:28
four. By default, it's positive, negative, and neutral. But you have the option to change those. Uh you can
12:16:33
include detailed results. So if I actually rerun this again, it says sentiment scores are LM generated, not
12:16:39
statistically measurements. They may be inconsistent across runs and rough indicators. And that is true. Uh there
12:16:45
is actually fine-tuned sentiment analysis. If you want to go to hugging face, we're going to cover that
12:16:50
literally towards the end of the video. Not today's lecture, but probably like lecture 30 or something like that. Also,
12:16:57
I don't know if you guys are watching like one lecture at a time. You're just trying to watch this all at once. Um I
12:17:02
don't know. Either way, I'm recording this over multiple days, but we uh go
12:17:08
over here and you can see the strength associated with the 095 confidence 0.98.
12:17:13
I'll run this again uh and we'll see if it gets the same score. It probably won't because again it's LM base and
12:17:20
it's very hard to get the same results over and over again. And uh it's the same exact results. So, take back what I say.
12:17:27
Let's go back to you wasted eight hours of my life. wasted eight hours of my life.
12:17:35
Unsubscribe. We'll run that. Let's go to the negative branch. Also, if you're seeing those
12:17:42
errors over here, I just haven't attached a trigger. So, I don't want to do that right now. You can see negative
12:17:48
the strength associated with it as well as the confidence. Cool. So, that is
12:17:54
sentiment analysis. Do I have anything else? There's a system prompt. So, we've
12:17:59
already covered how you could update system prompts. One of the cool things about a bunch of the AI nodes is the N
12:18:04
team already developed decent system prompts. It's not perfect. I would fine-tune this for your specific use
12:18:10
case and write a better prompt, but out of the box, it's way better than the you're a helpful assistant. And with
12:18:17
batch processing, yeah, so that is essentially the first part of sentiment
12:18:22
analysis. Something that is very similar is going to be this next node. So if we go into AI once again, we have something
12:18:29
called a text classifier. So very similar at the very top where we have an
12:18:34
option to specifically classify text and you can see we have that over
12:18:40
here. Person sentiment text to analyze. So very similar. And uh you want to add
12:18:47
in categories this time. So we could add in let's say for example we're doing a
12:18:53
review site or not review yeah let's say we want to classify reviews based off of
12:18:59
product. So we'll say tech product
12:19:06
or a tech service. So like imagine you're a PC store and
12:19:12
you either fix computers or you uh sell computers. So, someone is trying to
12:19:20
buyronics.
12:19:26
Someone needs help with their tech.
12:19:36
Now, I'd really write this like a way better description, but you can see I've just wrote some basic stuff. And uh what
12:19:42
I'll keep saying is my Windows computer
12:19:49
keeps saying it's infected with malware.
12:19:57
Right. And we're going to run this now. Misspelled probably malware. These aren't the best descriptions. And you
12:20:03
can see this jumps into the tech service branch. And we have one item there. If
12:20:09
we want to change this out and say I I want to buy
12:20:16
RAM for my computer.
12:20:23
My nice absolute great spelling of computer too. This should go into the other category and you can see it goes
12:20:29
into the tech product ranch. So you can add in categories as you want. Keep
12:20:34
expanding these out over there. Uh but this is classification. People sometimes get
12:20:40
these two confused. Just remember sentiment is like okay this is great terrible etc. And you can obviously
12:20:46
change these. This is kind of more broad and a lot of different applications with this. Sentiment analysis is a type of
12:20:54
text classification. So there's other things you can also have over here. So you can allow multiple classes to be
12:21:01
true. So imagine if someone says, "I want to I want to buy computer parts and
12:21:06
need help building a computer. I want to buy computer parts
12:21:13
and need help building a computer.
12:21:19
Should knock out both of these." Again, I don't know because I'm writing this on the fly, but
12:21:26
we'll see. And actually I didn't mark this as multiple. So this time it probably will.
12:21:36
And you can see it flagged for both tech product branch as well as tech service branch. Um when no clear match you could
12:21:43
have another option. So this is kind of like switch like okay what happens if we can't match something up? You could
12:21:49
either disregard it or output on other branch. You can see over here now we have other on that side of it. What else
12:21:57
is worth bringing up? System prompt. Again, you can see they did a pretty good job building out a basic system
12:22:02
prompt. And I would just change it up for that specific domain. So, it says, "Please classify the text provided on
12:22:08
the user into one of the following categories and use the provided formatting instructions below. Don't explain or only output the JSON." Again,
12:22:14
pretty nice because you don't even have to worry about output parser. I'd probably just expand on this slightly,
12:22:19
but out of the box, it's perfectly okay. So, that is going to be our text classifier. I'm just going to mark this
12:22:25
off on my page over here to the side. Next, we should talk about the
12:22:30
information extractor. Another really important node. So, we go to information extractor. And uh I like this a ton when
12:22:38
working with chat because essentially what you can do is pass in text and tell
12:22:44
it to say, "Hey, I want to grab this piece of information." So, let's say I
12:22:49
want to grab and I'm trying to think of something that would be kind of interesting. Um,
12:22:55
let's think of this for a second. We're going to have some sort of text
12:23:00
and oh, here's an idea. Company. So, let's say you want to have a chat and
12:23:06
say someone says, I want you to research you to research Upper Deck. Imagine
12:23:15
you're doing some sort of review of a potential customer and you just type into a chat, I want
12:23:21
you to research Upper Deck. So name is going to be company, type is going to be a string and you can change this to a
12:23:28
boolean, true or false, a date, a number or a string and say this is a company
12:23:35
that someone wants to look to. All right. So, we'll
12:23:42
require this and obviously like this is going to be built out based off of what you think people are going to be prompting um through your chat for, but
12:23:49
we'll execute this step and we will get nothing because I'm lazy
12:23:55
and I forgot to attach in a chat model. So, let's add in that over here. We'll execute the step
12:24:03
and we'll see what happens. It says company Upper Deck. So, we can
12:24:09
change this up again. And um let's say
12:24:15
I don't know, Billy's Cheese Steak
12:24:21
LLC had a phenomenal sandwich. I don't know.
12:24:30
And this is just like peak spelling. I can't spell cheese steak. I can't spell phenomenal. Um,
12:24:38
did I at least spell sandwich correct? I did. Obviously, I know how to spell, but it's it's hard sometimes with the
12:24:43
keyboard down here looking at the camera talking and uh we'll just see if it pulls out Philly's Cheese Stakes LLC.
12:24:50
And you can see it pulls out Philly Cheese Stake LLC. So, pretty cool. You can have your chat go directly into your
12:24:58
information extractor and then you get the JSON that you specifically want to pass on in your workflow. and maybe
12:25:05
based off of that information that was extracted, we send that to an API of some sort. Um, but very very common to
12:25:12
do it based around that. Another use case for the information extractor is just a lot of text. Imagine you have
12:25:20
like very long paragraph and I'll just give an example.
12:25:25
go into uh long paragraph
12:25:31
form is so like imagine you had a very large
12:25:36
piece of information and I'm just grabbing in text but you
12:25:42
have like all this text and you don't want to read it and you just want to grab a few pieces of information from it. You could do that over here. Um
12:25:51
and in this case like this is the first time I'm reading this Lauram text. I didn't even generate it. I just grabbed it directly from the website. But you
12:25:59
could just ask a few questions like what do you want to extract from here and it
12:26:04
out. So let's say for example, let's I'm just going to read this the text. So it
12:26:10
says contrary to popularity floor misma is not simply random text has roots in classic Latin literature from 45 BC
12:26:16
making it over 2,000 years old. Okay. So let's change this up instead of a name.
12:26:22
And what we're going to say is age. And we're going to say how old is the
12:26:27
text? How old is the text in years?
12:26:32
And what we're going to do is just say this is a number. Again, very basic, but you can see like there's a lot of text
12:26:38
over here. And let's add in some more as well.
12:26:43
Obviously, I don't want to spend all this extra money. But let's say we have all this text. All we care about in this text is the age. Just going to be a
12:26:50
number. I run this now and we'll get our result. It should say 2000. Well, it
12:26:55
says 2069. Why is that? That's weird. Why does it say 2069?
12:27:05
Oh, you know what it's doing? 45 BC and then it's adding 45 to get it to 2000
12:27:11
and then um No, that would Yeah. No, it's a little bit off on there. But
12:27:16
either way, um that is funny.
12:27:22
Is it still looking at that 2024 context window
12:27:27
to to show the math really quick? If you're confused why I got 2069, so well
12:27:33
45 years before zero. So 45 plus and
12:27:38
we're at year zero, right? So then you add 2024 and that's equal to 2069. So it
12:27:44
didn't take into effect. almost recording in 2026. But
12:27:50
yeah, that's where we got that number from. So it was actually pretty smart on that side of it. And you know, we can
12:27:56
add in, by the way, multiple attributes. So you can specify it's required or not. So if it doesn't figure it out, you can
12:28:02
just save this as like not required. And again, you can change the date and things like that. Ozer, here you have
12:28:08
other options. So this is your system prompt. Maybe you want to add in a little bit more context over there.
12:28:13
Again, it's not bad, but I would just add in more additional elements as needed. But I use this a lot. I've had a
12:28:20
customer that I essentially helped him and like take pages of information and just grab a few different pieces of
12:28:26
information that he wants. And man, it's a it's a game changer. Know that word gets thrown all the time, but that's
12:28:32
information extractor. I'm going to close out of uh from ISPM because we
12:28:39
don't need that anymore. And what we're going to do next is jump into the summarization chain. So very similar uh
12:28:47
to information extractor. However, it just gives you a summary at the very end. And there's a few different ways
12:28:52
that you could use the summarization chain. And you can take a look. It's like another one of these nodes.
12:29:00
We'll paste that in over here. Cool. And you can see a data to
12:29:06
summarize. Now, the one thing that's interesting with the summarization chain since we are taking a look at a lot more
12:29:13
information or it's just assumed we're taking a look at a lot more information. The end team does not allow you to
12:29:20
actually put in the text over here. So, you can see information extractor. We had this this text. However, that is not
12:29:26
available in the summarization chain which I have iffy thoughts about. I feel like you still should have that option
12:29:32
to classify the text or not classify but put in the text over there. I understand why they didn't. So you could either use
12:29:39
a node as input, you could upload a binary file or use a document loader. I
12:29:45
don't even want to cover document loaders until we get into the whole rag side of it. We're going to talk like an
12:29:50
hour or two hours on a rag, I have a feeling. So let's not cover that today. We already talked about binary files,
12:29:57
right? You can have like a PDF of some sort and pass it in or a document or you could literally just have all this
12:30:04
information in an edit set node or whatever JSON that you want and pass it directly in over there. Uh chunking
12:30:12
again I'm don't want to cover this until we get into the rag side of things. So we're just going to keep this by default
12:30:17
right now. And then you can see there's different ways to summarize over here as well. So you have map reduce which it
12:30:24
just recommends at over here. and it says summarize each document or chunk individually then summarize those
12:30:30
summaries. So I guess I have to teach you a little bit about rag but regardless what map produce essentially
12:30:36
does is you have a full document imagine it's a thousand paragraphs and we assume
12:30:42
each chunk is going to be one paragraph. So what it does is it summarizes each paragraph and then takes all those
12:30:49
summaries and then summarizes it at the very end. uh refine. What this does is
12:30:55
it summarizes the first paragraph. Then it reads paragraph 2 and says, "Hey, well, your final summary should include
12:31:01
this from paragraph 2. Then it goes to paragraph 3. Actually, you're missing this detail as well. Add that in." Chunk
12:31:07
four has this information. Add that back in. And then stuff, it's literally just uploading a whole document. And you say,
12:31:14
"Summarize this all at once." But based off of what you choose, you'll have different prompts over here to tweak. So
12:31:21
you have a lot more prompt engineering based around this. Uh so you can see subsequent refine prompt and then the
12:31:27
initial prompt and then stuff you just have the one prompt. So these will have two prompts each whether you use map
12:31:34
reduce or refine. By default it just uses map reduce but I would recommend that you choose one of these. Test it
12:31:40
out because sometimes you might get better results based off of what you want. start with map reduce to see if
12:31:46
it's working correctly for that particular domain or the piece of information that you have in there.
12:31:52
Again, I don't want to confuse you too much, but just remember map produce, we summarize each uh section and then we
12:32:01
take those summaries and summarize that for our final answer. We go into refine which every section we keep summarizing
12:32:09
it and get more information as we go a little bit further. And why this works as well is if you think about how a
12:32:14
paper is written, typically you're going to have most of the summary or information here at the very top. So it
12:32:20
should have a pretty good idea of what that paper is about, then stuff is really used for a small amount of text.
12:32:26
Like if you have a document that's 20 30 pages, probably wouldn't recommend stuff. But if you have something short
12:32:31
like that Loris film I showed you, probably isn't acceptable route to go. So that's a summarization chain. Another
12:32:39
thing that's really u important to know is different services have AI nodes in
12:32:46
over here and you can use them as well. So if you go into AI you'll notice that there's anthropic in Google Gemini as
12:32:53
well as open AAI. Uh so each of these have a lot of different nodes. So you
12:32:58
can see OpenAI has anything from generate a video which I wouldn't use this right now. We're going to talk about generating videos. You can create
12:33:04
conversations. You can work with files. You have audio actions, image actions, which is like analyze an image, generate
12:33:11
an image or edit image. You could also message a model and just uh go into open
12:33:17
AI to show you. Let's say we want to analyze an image of some sort. So we'll
12:33:23
go analyze image and uh yeah, you can see we have this particular node going into Gemini. You can go to Gemini on
12:33:31
there and you can see a lot more actions built. So we have 15 over here. I've used Gemini when I want to process
12:33:38
YouTube videos. So like I want to get a summary of a YouTube video. I find it really helpful just to go through the
12:33:44
native node directly in here and uh I just go to analyze a video and you can
12:33:49
put in a URL like I put just YouTube over here. I fill out all this stuff. So it says like text input. What are you
12:33:55
prompting it? The one thing that's kind of weird right now with Gemini, and I don't know if they're ever going to do
12:34:00
this or not, is I wish you could specify an output parser here, like just
12:34:05
annoying that you can't, not to go on a tangent. You also have anthropic. So if
12:34:11
I go to anthropic, you can see anthropic has 10 actions. So you analyze a document, upload a file, etc. Analyze an
12:34:17
image. So depending on your use case, you know, if it's maybe analyzing an image or video, maybe you don't want to
12:34:23
put that into whether a basic LLM chain or an AI agent because you just want
12:34:28
that specifically. And feel free to mess with it because sometimes it works in your workflow, sometimes it won't. Um,
12:34:36
I've had issues analyzing videos within a uh a basic LM chain or an AI agent
12:34:41
whereas this worked perfect. So wanted to show those to you. And lastly, what I
12:34:47
wanted to talk about is OCR. So, essentially what OCR allows us to do is
12:34:52
take an image of text, whether it's like handwritten text or uh photos, copied
12:34:58
text, and then extract all the information on to it and uh get some
12:35:04
results. So, let me just show you. We can do this in Mistl although OCR is
12:35:09
available in all the larger models. Mistrol right now and obviously things change really fast is the premier OCR
12:35:16
model. So you just go to Mistral AI and you can extract text. So it says
12:35:21
document extract text. You can choose the model which this is just the one over here. You set binary data document
12:35:29
type whether it's a document or an image and then you specify this. And I'd show
12:35:35
you how to do this. We're actually going to be using OCR as one of our examples in this video. So, we'll do an example
12:35:42
of like analyzing a YouTube video uh analyzing specifically with this and
12:35:47
maybe like one or two other examples. I think this is a pretty good use case just to show you some cool stuff that we
12:35:53
could build now that we know how an AI agent works, how we know also about some of these other nodes as well. So, I'm
12:35:59
going to take a quick break and then we're going to jump into a few examples shortly. All right. So, I brainstormed
12:36:05
three ideas. is we're going to build them out together. Uh I haven't even started the workflow, so you'll kind of just see my process of how we going to
12:36:11
build these out. And yeah, let's jump into it. So the first one over here and obviously if you want to try it yourself
12:36:17
first before I build these out, kind of like what we did with some of the earlier tutorials, go for it. I I
12:36:23
encourage you to do that. But example one, we take an input. We have a basic LM chain. Basic LM chain again. And then
12:36:29
we have an output over here. So chain one takes raw notes or ideas and generates a structured blog outline.
12:36:35
Chain two takes the outline and writes a polished into a a paragraph. So think
12:36:41
about how you're going to build this out. You can either do a chat trigger or you can do it manually and just set
12:36:48
something as like an edit set. I don't really care. And uh yeah, pause the video and get that going. Otherwise, I
12:36:55
will build this out. And I'm trying to think like do we have a chat checker? No, we don't have a chat trigger over here yet.
12:37:01
and uh yeah, let's jump into it. So, I'm going to do a chat trigger,
12:37:06
throw that in, and we're going to start this as a conversation. So, obviously the first part is we're going to get um
12:37:13
our raw notes or ideas. Then, we need to generate a structured blog outline from
12:37:19
that. Okay. So, what we're going to do is add in a basic LM chain.
12:37:26
Also to mention, I am not going to be writing the best prompts. I am not going to do a ton of testing, which real world
12:37:31
scenario, you are going to have to do that. So, please make these better if you're pushing them into production.
12:37:37
Make sure you're testing them. Make sure like there's a lot of other steps that I'm skipping over here. Don't watch this
12:37:43
and think like, oh, you can build a workflow in 20 minutes and it's good. No, it's not the case. And I say that
12:37:49
because I see a lot of Upwork jobs and freelance jobs that people say, can you build this in an hour? And it's like, come on, guys. Like, be realistic. So,
12:37:56
what we're going to do is we have our like raw notes and ideas. So, I'm going to say I'm going to create a another
12:38:04
message over here. We're going to have our system message. We're going to expand this out and say you are an AI
12:38:11
agent or let's not say an agent. Let's say you are
12:38:18
a um an outline creator because that's what
12:38:23
we're doing first, right? I should have probably just copied this over
12:38:29
so we can keep the verbiage the same. All right, so chain one takes the raw notes and
12:38:35
generates a structured blog outline. So you are an outline creator. A user will give you
12:38:44
few pieces of information. Your goal
12:38:52
is to take that and generate
12:38:57
an outline for a blog post.
12:39:05
For example, we have to give an example over here.
12:39:10
Um, we'll say user, let's do an AI example. We'll say user
12:39:17
message system
12:39:23
message best practices.
12:39:28
All right. So like intro user versus system message
12:39:38
body. We'll say like user message
12:39:46
body system message
12:39:51
and then we'll do body
12:39:56
comparing
12:40:02
messages conclusion
12:40:07
let's write let's think about our conclusion I'll just say like summarize both of these summarize
12:40:16
like this is so simple and obviously like I would want to layer this with
12:40:22
multiple examples like okay here's example one here's example two Um let's
12:40:27
do another example actually for example
12:40:33
let's say example one but here are two examples
12:40:42
all right so example one AI
12:40:50
it's going to be like that great and I should probably just make
12:40:57
these a little bit different. Uh it's cool. All right. And let's do a
12:41:04
second article. We'll need this best practices for this
12:41:10
one. So that was like a comparison article. Let's do another article over here. Example two.
12:41:18
What are we going to do now? Um,
12:41:23
oh, you know what we're going to do? 19 No, no. I'm I'm going to think about
12:41:29
like doing a a card set. We'll do like a 1948
12:41:35
1948 Bowman basketball.
12:41:42
It's like basketball cards. Okay. And then let's just write these
12:41:48
out. like this.
12:41:55
Okay. So, introwise um
12:42:00
history of Bowman basketball cards
12:42:12
and checklist. Cool. Then we're going to set a body. You know, let me say let's say most
12:42:19
valuable cards recent auction sales.
12:42:26
I know this is mine.
12:42:31
Okay, we'll put like future Bowman basketball releases.
12:42:40
Obviously, like this is going to be better if it's fine-tuned towards something in general. Like I would
12:42:45
assume someone that's going to be building out an outline for a blog post is going to be focused on a niche and it
12:42:50
might be a little bit easier. I just gave two random examples, an AI one and then a card one. So, we're going to just
12:42:56
test this out. I'm going to save this really fast and let's think of something we're going to do an outline on. Um,
12:43:05
what? Let's do trying to think of a good outline.
12:43:11
Let's do an outline on Ellis and Chains. Ellis in chains
12:43:18
Seattle grunge scene. Maybe it's something like that.
12:43:24
Let's see what happens. And uh that did not work because I have the wrong open AI account. Man, I knew that would come
12:43:31
to bite me. I still need to delete that old account. All right, let's try this again. So
12:43:39
anticlimatic. All right, let's see if we get a good outline.
12:43:47
And uh I don't think it'll be too difficult.
12:43:53
Obviously, like I said, probably better off if you're fine-tuning it for a specific use case rather than what I
12:44:00
have at everything broad. But all right, title, intro. It's
12:44:05
interesting. It actually gave me a lot more stuff over here. And you can see brief hook, quick thesis, suggestion,
12:44:12
length, section one, section two, section three, section four, section
12:44:17
five. This is actually pretty good.
12:44:22
I'm fine with this. I mean, we're not going to use all of it, but like I think this is good. So the second part, it
12:44:28
says takes outline writes the polish intro paragraph. So let's do that. So
12:44:34
we're going to get another basic LM chain. And again with this you see that I
12:44:39
didn't attach any tools. I didn't do anything else crazy. I just literally just put that over there. So we have our
12:44:45
basic LLM chain. And then uh we'll go over here and instead of connected we'll
12:44:52
define below there. You're going to say this is an expression. Drag and drop this over here. So you can see JSON.ext.
12:44:59
I'm going to add in a prompt system message. And uh
12:45:04
all I'm going to say is interrop. So
12:45:10
based on I'll put that over here. Let me make this full thing. I don't need that to be
12:45:18
an expression per se. I just want to make that there. Cool. You're man. I don't know why it's cut
12:45:25
out. All right. is
12:45:31
to write an intro paragraph
12:45:36
that is 200ish words when you should be more dynamic we or
12:45:44
sorry give more of a definition I'll say 150 to 250 words based
12:45:51
on the outline of a
12:45:58
I don't know It needs to be paper say an article
12:46:04
a user will give outline
12:46:11
will give you an outline.
12:46:16
All right. So your goal is to write an intro paragraph that is 250 250 words based on the outline of an article. Your
12:46:22
user will give you an outline. All you need to do
12:46:28
is write it based on an eighth grade
12:46:34
reading level. It's fine there. You know, there's other things you could define like how do you want your intro?
12:46:41
You know, type the tone. Like there's a lot of other things. I'm just going to keep it like this to keep it basic.
12:46:49
And again, I mess up because I don't throw a model over here.
12:46:54
And uh that will rerun that again. It'll be fine. 150 to 250 words for an
12:47:02
intro on Allison Chains. And we'll be good to go. So we take a look at our
12:47:07
output now. And here we go. So it says Allison Chain sits in the center of Seattle grunge
12:47:13
story because their music captured both heavy sound, darker feelings marked the era formed in the 1980s. The band mixed
12:47:19
metalike riffs with haunting vocal harmonies and lyrics. uh those elements made them stand out in a scene blah blah
12:47:26
blah talks a little bit more about the album facelift will examine the human side
12:47:31
talks a little bit more I think this is a pretty good intro and all I did if you go back over take a look at the input
12:47:38
Allison chains Seattle grun scene we got our outline and uh now we have our
12:47:44
article and obviously like you can add in steps there's something called human in loop where you can actually approve things before it gets sent along I just
12:47:51
wanted to show you chain into chain. No pun intended with Alice and chains. I didn't even think about
12:47:57
that when I was just given that example. But uh cool. So now what I want to do is
12:48:04
our second example. There like I said I I thought of these while I was seating dinner and uh made
12:48:10
these out and uh we're going to go through them. So our second one is we're going to have like a review that's input
12:48:16
and over here we're going to find the sentiment of a new feature and then send it to a branch. So positive branch will
12:48:22
extract specific features mentioned generate a thank you response negative branch will categorize a complaint type
12:48:29
check if the critical bug is mentioned create a jar ticket I put that as optional like I'm not going to do it but
12:48:35
you can see with this type of stuff like you can really expand this out notify the product team we'll do the product
12:48:41
team I'm the product team myself and I and generate an empathetic response which I'll just generate myself as well
12:48:48
a neutral branch will flag for manual review the feedback backlog. Yeah, you get the point. So, let's talk about the
12:48:55
review. Let's just pretend we have like a manual trigger. We already have a manual trigger. We do.
12:49:02
Zoom out. We're going to steal it wherever it's at. There it is. All the way at the top. Going to steal that and
12:49:09
bring it down over here. Cool. Then what we're going to do is throw in
12:49:14
edit sets. We're going to put in our review and let's just take the side of any end
12:49:23
and what we're going to do is pretend there's a bug. So, we're going to say
12:49:31
the new AI agent, let's just pretend there's a new AI agent, does not work
12:49:39
with Google Gemini 4. tried everything.
12:49:47
Tried everything, but my production workflows
12:49:57
are useless. Also, I put this in the wrong section. It's been a long day. Uh, we're going to
12:50:04
say review over here like that. Cool. So, we have our review and our edit set. We have our manual trigger. Next, what
12:50:10
we need to do is find the sentiment. So, we're going to do just close out of that. Go to AI
12:50:17
and then find our sentin analysis. So, we have that over here. I'm just going
12:50:22
to keep it very basic. Positive, negative, neutral. No big deal. Let's copy in our LM
12:50:31
over here. We'll use something cheap. That's fine. And let's uh test this out.
12:50:36
So, I'm just going to run this over here. Workflow has issues. And well, you know why the issue is? because I never
12:50:42
actually passed in the data. So if I execute the step, we have that there. We got to pass in our data. Make a lot of
12:50:49
mistakes. I'm tired. Cool. So we have this over here and uh we'll see which
12:50:54
branch it goes on. This goes back into our issue we had a little bit earlier with the sentiment
12:51:00
analysis, which it seems like it's broken for GPT5 mini for some reason. I don't know why, but it was anthropic.
12:51:06
Not a big deal. So, I'll just grab that, paste it over here, and we'll use that
12:51:13
for this example. Let's run it again. Should be fine.
12:51:19
And you see it goes into negative. Great. So, now what we need to do is kind of design the workflow. So, for the
12:51:25
negative branch over here, we got to categorize the complaint type.
12:51:31
So, we could do like a text classifier of some sort. Let me just make a sticky note.
12:51:40
So, we'll just go over here
12:51:46
and uh we'll go to our text classifier.
12:51:52
All right. So, we have our text classifier that's going to go in over here. All right. So, we're going to categorize
12:51:58
a complaint type. We're going to have to fill this out. I don't know how we're going to fill this out yet. We'll figure
12:52:04
it out. check if the critical bug is mentioned. Well, we did talk about a bug. So, we should probably do like an
12:52:11
information extractor as well. So, what I'm thinking
12:52:19
is we go over here, information extractor.
12:52:25
Saw it here in a second. I'm just going to go down here and grab it. I need our information extractor as well. And I
12:52:32
just close that out and both of those.
12:52:40
Cool. What else do we need? We're not going to do the jerro ticket. Notify the product
12:52:45
team and write a response. So let's scribe agent. We could write a basic LM chain
12:52:52
for our response. So this will be the response.
12:52:58
Again, we can just grab a cheap OpenAI chat model
12:53:04
and then other thing that we need over here is
12:53:09
notifying the product team. So, what we'll do is have a Gmail trigger
12:53:16
and we're going to send it Gmail. So, we'll say send a message. Great. So, this will be over here
12:53:24
and let's jump into it. So let's think about each of these steps.
12:53:30
So the first one, let's just generate an empathetic response. So we're going to do the basic LM chain. We're going to
12:53:36
say cat. We don't need the connected. We're going
12:53:42
to use define below. And we're going to pass in this
12:53:48
information. So we need to pass in that review into the user message. And then we're going
12:53:54
to add in a prompt and we say based on
12:54:00
the review, write an empathetic
12:54:06
message to the customer who had a bad experience.
12:54:14
Obviously, if you have some type of documentation, you're going to write this a little bit better. Go for it. I'm
12:54:20
doing a two second YouTube video and you can see we have this over here
12:54:28
and it says really sorry frustrating must be over here. Thank you for letting us know we'll priority is getting it fixed to help us investigate escalate
12:54:35
quickly. So like this makes the assumption that we don't have that information where you know maybe we do
12:54:40
already have that info. I don't know. We could keep that as is. You can obviously tweak it. I'm not going to do a lot of
12:54:47
tweaking for this one. And then let's pretend like we send the message back into our customer. I'm just going to
12:54:53
send it to myself.
12:54:59
But you know what? I don't actually like this because we should have an output
12:55:04
parser and we're going to tweak this say based on the view write empathy also
12:55:11
generate a subject line. Cool. So we're going to have this create a subject as well. We're going to add an
12:55:18
output parser. So, we will go and do that.
12:55:24
And we'll put over here. We're going to say email message.
12:55:32
And then we're going to do subject line.
12:55:39
Oops.
12:55:47
subject. Sorry.
12:55:54
Let's run this again and do this.
12:56:01
Hopefully, we get the correct information.
12:56:12
Honestly, the more I think about it, like, yeah, we could Oh, we'll keep this going. All right. What's my error over
12:56:17
here? Model doesn't fit.
12:56:25
All right. So, let's see what we put over here. Based on the review, write empathetic message.
12:56:33
Oh, you know what? We should probably call this just message. Probably getting confused.
12:56:40
Let's run that again. Make sure those are one to one.
12:56:48
And then while that's running, let's go in our information extractor.
12:56:54
We're going to have our text. We're going to add an attribute. And we're going to call this product
12:57:01
bug. And because we're saying over here, I
12:57:06
I'll fix this here in a second, but it says categorize complaint type check if critical bug is mentioned. So, we should
12:57:13
probably call this critical bug. Critical product bug.
12:57:22
There is something wrong with the software provided.
12:57:30
Cool. So, what we can do, I'll test this out in a second with this basic LM
12:57:36
chain. I'm not sure why it's not working. I mean, I'm sure I can debug it in a second. Let's see if this information extractor is working.
12:57:44
Let's pass that in.
12:57:51
It needs to take this review. Cool.
12:57:57
It should say this is required as well. The new AI agent does not work with Google Gemini 4 causing problems.
12:58:03
Perfect. Let's make sure that's required as well. So that's working. Let's pretend that's sending over to uh
12:58:11
our team as well. So we'll send this over there again. We'll say new critical bug.
12:58:21
And honestly, just based off of this extraction, I think this is fine. I was saying like I don't think we really need
12:58:27
the classifier on this side of things because we're just going to look at bugs in general. I mean we could get super
12:58:32
nuanced and do that. I don't think it's we don't need it for this one. All right. So we have that over here. We
12:58:38
need to get this chain working as well. So going to do is build that out. So
12:58:45
product team knows we just got to figure out why this chain isn't working. So we have this review. It goes in over here.
12:58:52
Now why does this not work? I think I might have to provide the exact example in this message for the system message
12:59:00
and uh again if this doesn't work I'll just put that exact example. All right.
12:59:05
So it says model output doesn't fit to continue execution on error. So
12:59:13
I'm not sure why that's not working but we'll go over here load this up.
12:59:21
Example,
12:59:26
we'll just say user I hated
12:59:32
using this product. Then we'll say AI
12:59:42
message. Sorry to hear that you had a negative
12:59:48
experience. Also, I'm just going to go and change
12:59:55
this out.
13:00:01
Obviously, this is pretty terrible saying like we are sorry and things like that, but it's
13:00:07
okay. Cool. So,
13:00:14
Let's see if this works. Should
13:00:19
I'm going to execute the step again. I mean, I'm I think I'm very explicit
13:00:26
there. Man, did it really break again? I'm
13:00:32
generally curious if it did. All right, so let's see what is going on
13:00:40
over here.
13:00:51
I wonder if it's a special character because you can see we have the text on that side of things.
13:01:06
All right, let's try this. Sometimes the basic LM chain is a little buggy. Let's try our AI agent.
13:01:16
Going to try the same exact thing over and again with their agents. It happens.
13:01:21
Not a big deal. You got to pivot. And uh I'm keeping this in here just to show
13:01:26
you that things happen. So this says output formats.
13:01:34
find below. Pass in this review.
13:01:41
Add in the system message. Try the system message here.
13:01:47
Yeah. So, go back in and try this out. And if it doesn't work here, obviously
13:01:52
like I have another bug which maybe I'm oblivious to see, but I don't think I
13:01:57
should have an issue. I mean, it's pretty straightforward
13:02:03
and it could be uh the output parser is bugged as well or I'm missing like the
13:02:08
most obvious thing. It it worked like you can see I I didn't change anything. So, just an error with
13:02:15
the basic LM chain. Uh you can see we have this over here subject line and
13:02:22
output. So, really we can go back into our email. We can define our subject
13:02:28
line. So you can just grab your subject line there. You can grab this message which will just say it's text. And uh
13:02:35
yeah, there we go. I could execute this out as well. I can show it to my Google account. I'm not going to run it. But
13:02:41
yeah, so we have our negative sentiment. We send a email to the person saying we're sorry. And then we extract what
13:02:48
the bug was from that message and we send it to our engineering team. Obviously, again, I could have created a
13:02:54
Jira ticket pretty easily. I' never set up Jira with an any. I know it's a popular thing to do. And really, if I
13:03:01
spent some time, we could categorize all the different types of bugs and and I think that'd be useful for like a a
13:03:07
engineering team to do like, oh, this is the type of bug we're experiencing. So that way you can fix those bugs as they
13:03:12
pop up. But I just didn't do that here. So next, what we want to do is let's go
13:03:17
into our neutral branch. We'll like flag for manual review. So, we could just say it's like in a spreadsheet.
13:03:24
And uh yeah, let's do that. So, what we're going to do is
13:03:29
go to sheets. Let's just pretend we have a sheet over here. We're going to insert
13:03:34
into a sheet. So, we'll say appender row in sheets. And let's imagine we have a
13:03:41
sheet. And again, this could be a database. This could be wherever else. We're just going to populate some information.
13:03:47
I'm going to load up Sheets accounts. I'm going to go in all YouTube video
13:03:53
update. We're going to load this up here in a second. We're going to create another sheets. We'll say sheet six
13:04:01
and we'll say this is going to be a um annual review.
13:04:10
Well, that exact name is going to be what? Neutral. So, it should say neutral reviews.
13:04:17
Go and fix that. Then we'll put like time stamp.
13:04:24
Oh, we could add in like user emails and all this other stuff. I'm kind of skipping that over here. Don't need it
13:04:29
for today. I mean, hopefully you guys understand. Just add one additional step. So then all we do over here is go
13:04:37
and add in our neutral view. Obviously, we don't have one over here. So, I kind of want to change this up. I don't want
13:04:44
to get rid of this. But yeah, here's what we're going to do.
13:04:51
You say it's like review two.
13:04:57
The product is okay. Favorite
13:05:03
I've seen worse. Like that seems pretty neutral. Then we're going to just send in JSON
13:05:10
review 2 over here. Hopefully it gets into the neutral step.
13:05:16
And uh sweet neutral branch. And you could just literally just drop this in
13:05:24
neutral review is there. And then time stamp. Let's just go JSON now.
13:05:30
JSON. Now I thought that was the time. It's not the time. I got to fix that. Um I'll
13:05:38
just check that for a second.
13:05:43
I think it's just this actually. No, it's not. All right, I'm back. I literally just
13:05:49
asked Claude and it's actually just dollar now. And I didn't need to have the extra JSON. Anyways, so we have that
13:05:57
now and uh we can just execute the step over here and it'll populate within our
13:06:03
spreadsheet. So you can see we have our neutral review and then time stamp so someone can review it a little bit
13:06:08
later. All right, great. And then let's look at the easy one. So, extract a specific feature mentioned and then
13:06:14
generate a thank you for the response. So, maybe we want to extract that feature and then put it into a spreadsheet. So, I'm just going to go
13:06:20
over here and create a sheet seven. And then we'll put like feature
13:06:26
liked. I don't know. I could again I I'm just architecting. I'm building this on the on the fly. Like this is not great
13:06:34
architecture. This is really great thinking. Um but I just wanted to show different ways that you could use this
13:06:39
and really start expanding this out. So, all we're doing on this one is what?
13:06:44
Generate a thank you message. So, we already have something very similar. So, we'll just say
13:06:51
this. Go in here and instead of
13:06:57
based on the review, write a
13:07:04
thank you message
13:07:09
had a great experience.
13:07:16
Also generate a subject line example.
13:07:33
Cool. Um, so we're gonna say thank you
13:07:38
for such great feedback
13:07:44
for our Oh, this is pretty bad subject line.
13:07:50
Thanks for the feedback.
13:07:56
And we're going to say, I loved the new AI agent.
13:08:03
Cool. That's fine. Again, it's very basic. You
13:08:09
can always tweak your prompts. So, that'll be one version of it. We'll call this JSON review three. So, we had one
13:08:17
and two, right? Just double check. Yeah, we'll do three.
13:08:23
I loved the AI agent feature.
13:08:29
Great. It saves me hundreds of hours.
13:08:38
Okay, so we have that. So we know that's built in. And then lastly, we're going to do our information extractor.
13:08:46
Just going to be instead of bug, we're going to change this up. We're going to go in here
13:08:54
and put favorite feature.
13:09:01
the feature someone like
13:09:07
and I'd make this optional because sometimes people will say positive things and not give a feature and then
13:09:13
um go to the spreadsheet route. Now, one other thing to note is like this is very
13:09:18
messy. You can't tell what's going on. So, in real world, you're going to re label all these. You're going to leave
13:09:24
sticky notes. You're going to space these out. As I mentioned, for like the probably 10th time, this is a YouTube
13:09:31
video. I'm trying to teach you how these nodes work, how to build flows. So, there's definitely things to work on
13:09:37
making this better if you're going to actually present this to a customer. Anyways, going back over here, we're
13:09:43
going to go into sheet seven now. And uh we'll use JSON review 3.
13:09:51
It's not going to be a neutral review. We need to refresh this.
13:10:00
It's going to fetch these columns and then this feature linked. I'm just literally just going to go here,
13:10:07
copy this JSON review 2, populate it over here. Say this is JSON review 3.
13:10:16
Yeah, we can just run this one more time over here with three. It should go into the positive branch.
13:10:25
Why did this not work? Oh. Oh, that's why it didn't work.
13:10:32
It should be review three. Cool. We have review three there now.
13:10:38
Then we go over here. Execute the step. Should go positive.
13:10:45
Positive branch. Boom. And then you can see if we extract this over here should
13:10:51
say the AI agent.
13:10:58
Oh, you know what? Because we're still using initial JSON review. I was like that is
13:11:05
interesting. Always make sure these are correct. Look at that AI agent feature. And then that would just get populated
13:11:10
into the spreadsheet. And you can see in sheet seven
13:11:16
we actually do not get the correct result. We just get that um
13:11:22
that's why we're not we don't have this as an expression and also this is off. It should be favorite feature
13:11:29
that now if I execute the step always double check your work.
13:11:34
Cool. Now we have that working over there and then uh
13:11:41
our agents that will send the email. So let's test what this agent would uh
13:11:47
populate. And we can send that email if we want.
13:11:52
I probably won't, but thank you so much for your feedback. We're thrilled to hear the AI agent
13:11:58
feature saving you hundreds of hours. Thanks. Glad the AI gen is saving us. That's fine. Again, I would probably
13:12:04
recommend you spend some time and build out a way better system message. And I've taught you the fundamentals behind it, but this video would be way too long
13:12:12
to build out something for like a a production level for this over here.
13:12:18
All right, and we're going to do one more. I'm going to take another quick break and then we'll jump into example
13:12:25
number three. I'm just going to throw this over here, though. So, example three,
13:12:31
add it on here. Cool. So, here's our third example.
13:12:36
Build this out a little bit later. I'll just drag and drop this here. But what we're going to do is essentially our OCR
13:12:44
example. I promise you guys we do OCR. We're going to use a filter and things like that. So, we'll probably set that
13:12:50
up. I'll probably record that a little bit tomorrow morning. Jump into there and uh yeah, I will see you guys there.
13:12:56
All right. So, example three. I have this ready to go. So what we're going to do is we're going to grab input of an
13:13:02
image. Then we're going to use OCR to extract information, extract if someone has experiences or not on their resume
13:13:09
for a specific job, filter them out, and then add otherwise to a spreadsheet. And
13:13:15
few things we'll need for that. First is résumés. So how did I find rums? Well, I literally went to the data science
13:13:21
Reddit and I just searched ré and I grabbed these four. You can go to any type of professional Reddit and I'm sure
13:13:27
people are posting their resumes. So, um because people always want to get them critiqued. So, you can just go and
13:13:33
screenshot these. I already saved these on my computer. So, screenshot them or save them. I'm just saving these as PNG
13:13:38
files. Another thing you'll need to get is Mistl. So, how you want to set up
13:13:44
Mistl just go into console.mmistl.ai. And then you're going to want to go into
13:13:50
your API keys over here to the top left. And I'll show you how to set this up here in a second. Let me actually do
13:13:55
that. So I'm going to go and search for Mistral AI extract text. And then I'm going to go
13:14:02
over here. You're going to create a new credential. I already have an account over here. So I'm just going to click my pencil icon and going into AI Studio.
13:14:10
Create a new key. I'm just going to say this is any big course.
13:14:15
It's fine. You can set an expiration date. I'm not going to set one for now. I'm going to create a new key. And uh
13:14:22
you'll see I have this key over here. Now I'm going to just going to pause the video probably and create a new key so
13:14:28
that way you guys don't see this, but ideally you would just copy this key and go back into any and then fill this API
13:14:34
key over here. Obviously I don't want this to be shared. So I'm just going to delete this key. Also you might have to
13:14:40
add in credits. I believe Mistral is still free if they train on your data. Um could be wrong on that. So if you
13:14:47
need to add in u money into Mistl, please do so. Again, I haven't taken a
13:14:52
look at that documentation in probably a few months, but I should be good on my side. Just double check it works on
13:14:58
yours. All right, I'm going to create a new key, and I will be right back.
13:15:06
All right, I'm back. So, my key has been created. I just called this Nan Live 1230, and I I put it back into myself.
13:15:13
Obviously, name this as you want, but now we have our OCR. The first thing we need to do though is how are we going to
13:15:19
actually get the image into any N? I'm going to do the lazy route and just set up a form over here. Obviously, there's
13:15:26
other approaches that you could use, but I feel like this is going to be easy way to just test this out and we know how to
13:15:31
add in binary data. So, what we're going to do is say this is like a resume
13:15:36
uploader. I'm going to do like literally the MVP as fast as possible. So, field name,
13:15:43
we'll just call this data as I see that all the time. uh label, we'll say resumeé goes here.
13:15:50
Element type, but we're going to call this a file. And we're going to accept only one file. Uh we can test this out
13:15:56
as well. So, I'm just going to grab one of the resumes. We'll throw it in over here. Click submit. And we just make
13:16:02
sure that we get our file. Boom. We have this file. And if you're watching this video, uh thank you for uploading to the
13:16:08
data science Reddit. But yeah, so we have that over here. And uh now what we want to do is see if
13:16:15
Mistl can actually extract the text from there. So going to mistrol obviously you have your account we're going to
13:16:21
resource. We're going to use a document operation. We're going to extract text model. They only give you one option. So
13:16:27
ML OCR latest document type. You can choose a document or image. I'm using an image because like this is an image over
13:16:33
here. Uh input type you can use a URL or binary data. I'll show you URL in a
13:16:38
second but we can do binary data as well. input binary data name. Well, it's just called data. Over here, you have
13:16:44
other options for like batch processing and things like that too. But I'm just going to execute this step
13:16:49
and uh what you can see is we have our information. So we have this in markdown
13:16:55
and just to go into our table, you can see we scroll down over here. Extracted
13:17:01
text is our information. So do we want all this? Not really. We just want our extracted text. So what we're going to
13:17:08
do is just have a edit set. Go edit set and then we'll just grab
13:17:14
this extracted text and populate it there. I'm also going to just put our data really fast and uh we will grab
13:17:22
that out and then you can execute the step. Obviously we could clean this up if we wanted to but I think this is
13:17:28
fine. All we're going to ask is some questions based around it like does this person have uh specific information? So,
13:17:36
um, because you can see a bunch of skills are listed over here, and we're just going to do essentially a keyword
13:17:41
extraction. So, going back over to this resume, this is the one we're taking a look at. So, maybe we want to say, hey,
13:17:48
does someone have SQL experience? Great. What type of projects do they have? Like, obviously, I I'm not putting a ton
13:17:55
of thought into the design on this one. I'm just teaching you guys how to use the nodes. A real world experience. Like
13:18:01
if you're going to build out a resume extractor, you're going to spend hours trying to think about like all the different nuances. I just thought about
13:18:07
this right before recording. So what we're going to do next is extract if they have experiences or not. So let's
13:18:14
add in our information extractor. So we're going to say information extractor hop over here and we're going to do is
13:18:21
first pass in our data. So, and you know, actually, you know
13:18:26
what would be kind of interesting as well? If we did a summary of what this
13:18:31
guy's resume is, that would be kind of cool. So, out of the box thinking over
13:18:36
here, let's go and grab where is our thing at? The summarization chain. We're going to just grab that.
13:18:43
Out of the box thinking, we're going to do this really fast. I don't know why I just thought of this, but that's fine.
13:18:48
And, uh, we're going to use that to summarize this. Cool. So we have our summarization
13:18:54
chain. We'll set this up here in a second. I also kind of wanted just to do that so I can copy over this. Save some
13:19:00
time. All right. So information extractor. We have all this. What do we want to uh
13:19:06
grab? So I'm trying to think really quick. What do we want to grab from here? Um we'll say like SQL experience
13:19:15
experience mentions
13:19:20
SQL in the text. Okay. Some jobs require master's
13:19:26
degrees. So maybe want to do that. Um we have a certification. Do we have even a
13:19:32
degree? Oh, we have education right here at the top. We have a bachelor's. So we'll go over here. Master's degree.
13:19:38
sister's degree. Um,
13:19:53
and I'm saying either yes or no. So, I'm going to say like over here as well, either yes or no.
13:20:01
All right. So, we're looking for SQL. We're looking for a master's degree. Um, next we should probably look at
13:20:09
another example. Obviously, like this is someone that just graduated college in this instance, but we should probably do
13:20:16
like Python as well. So, we're going to call this like and I'm just going to call this masters.
13:20:23
Great. We'll just do three. So, we'll say like Python experience.
13:20:28
Python experience mentions Python
13:20:36
the text. What else can we put in here really fast? Um,
13:20:44
I think this is fine. I mean, this is a very basic resume.
13:20:50
I And I would not recommend you build out your resume like this. If you're applying for a job right now in data
13:20:55
science, you're not going to get a job. But that's fine. Obviously, there's nuances like every job will have like 10 or 15 required skills. So, I'm curious
13:21:02
where uh this will populate. I'm just going to click execute step
13:21:08
and take a look. So, it says SQL experience, yes. Master's degree, no. Python experience, yes. And we go to his
13:21:14
resume. So, mentioned SQL right over here. It should mention Python over here
13:21:20
as well. You can see Python. Python used multiple times. And then no master's
13:21:25
degree. So that's why we have yes, yes, no. Really, really cool because we just essentially took an image, we extracted
13:21:32
all the text over there, and then we're looking for specific pieces of information. So we built that out. Next,
13:21:37
what we can do too is do a summarization chain. So what I'm going to do on this
13:21:43
one, since it's super easy, we're just going to use a stuff. Uh we're going to use the node input JSON over here
13:21:49
because you can see the JSON is just this markdown. Uh we'll use simple, which is just defined over here.
13:21:56
And then it says, "Write a concise summary of the following resume." I'm just going to say that following resume.
13:22:03
That's it. Again, super basic. I didn't really change stuff, but execute steps
13:22:08
and we'll see what happens. Like this is a terrible prompt. I would not recommend you just only use this prompt, but we're
13:22:14
going to use it out of the box. And resume summary, data science, and you
13:22:19
know what? You know what should we probably put over here? Write a concise two to three sentence
13:22:28
summary of the following resume. And I know I misspelled sentence, so we're going to fix that. I don't know why I always misspell it. So, we'll test it
13:22:35
out. Now, obviously, there's other nodes that you could use, but take a look. Data science
13:22:41
intern who graduated a bachelor's in computer science engineering from a guru. I'm not even going to try to
13:22:47
pronounce that. University in 2023 with a 8.4 CGPA, technical skills in Python,
13:22:52
machine learning frameworks, blah blah blah. Right? So I essentially what we've
13:22:58
done now with the the summarization chain and information extractor. There's specific things I want to look at a resume. We've extracted that. We also
13:23:05
have a a quick summary. Okay. So here's the cool thing as well. We can now merge
13:23:11
these together if we really wanted to. So what we can go here is find a merge node. And what we'll do is just merge
13:23:19
these together. Great. And how I want to do this is combine. And we're going to combine by
13:23:26
position, too. So, we're going to go here like that. Also, they probably should have just pinned our data here so
13:23:32
we don't get extra calls. Fortunately, I'm going have to rerun that one over here. I'll just pin it. Save us some
13:23:39
time. Great. So, it's pinned all of this just so that way this can uh be tested.
13:23:46
We'll execute this workflow. I'm just going to drag this in over here. It's not going to really do anything, but sometimes you saw from the merge
13:23:52
section, we have issues. So now if I go into this merge, you can see we have text and then we have SQL experience
13:23:58
etc. You know I probably should re label this instead of just having this as text. But that's fine. We have this all
13:24:04
over here. Next what we can do is create a filter if we wanted to. So let's put in a filter.
13:24:10
And what we can do on this filter now is go over and based off of things. So we
13:24:17
want to filter everyone that has SQL experience. So we're going to say is equal to yes.
13:24:24
We're going to add in Python experience equal to yes. And then we're going to
13:24:30
add in over here, let's say you want to have a master's degree. And I wouldn't get a job because I don't have a master's degree. Um, but we're going to
13:24:36
say this has to be a yes as well. So you'll see since all three of these are not met, this is disregarded. So
13:24:44
unfortunately, you did not get the job. However, if we remove the option for the master's degree, you'll see it is kept.
13:24:51
So we'll put in the whatever we want over here. Obviously it changes job to job and we have that there. Cool. So
13:24:57
let's just imagine we only care about Python experience and SQL experience which is um very fresh like you don't
13:25:04
have a lot over there. Obviously there's a lot into the resume here. I'm not saying this guy doesn't have experience. I'm just saying if you're trying to get
13:25:10
a data science job and you don't have Python experience and SQL experience, you're not going to get that job. Anyways, let's go now and add this to
13:25:17
sheets or a data table. It it really doesn't matter to be honest with you. We'll just do sheets. So, we'll just go
13:25:22
through this in sheets, append our own sheets. We're going to use literally the same sheet that we've been using like
13:25:28
this entire tutorial. I don't know why I've just decided to use this sheet that I'm using for uh YouTube timestamps, but
13:25:36
that's okay. Go over here to sheet eight and we'll say um resumeé
13:25:44
writeups. We'll say SQL
13:25:49
Python masters. Great. And then what we can do now
13:25:57
is grab this sheet eight which obviously you can re label these sheets as well.
13:26:02
And what we can do is send our different things. So we have resume write up,
13:26:08
SQL experience, masters and Python experience. And I can
13:26:14
execute the step. And check it out. We have that. Now, if I go over here, boom. So, obviously, we
13:26:22
can test this out with others, and I would recommend that you do so. I'm just going to unpin these, and we're going to test it with one more example over here.
13:26:30
So, we'll find another. Obviously, I have I have four different
13:26:35
ones on here, so we can uh really mess with it if we wanted to. So, which one
13:26:41
do we want to now? All right. So, we've already done this one. I'm going to close it out. This doesn't have a name.
13:26:47
This doesn't have a name either. We have first a last name. That's a pretty cool name. This is way too blocky.
13:26:57
University of London. Oh, that's not University of London. Middle over here.
13:27:02
I guess that's fine. We'll execute workflow.
13:27:08
I think it's this one. Obviously, didn't have a name on it. So,
13:27:13
we're just going to see it go through the live workflow over here. And uh I'm curious what ends up
13:27:20
happening. Did it filter?
13:27:29
It got disregarded. So, no SQL experience on that resume. Let's see if that's correct. So, that was this one
13:27:35
over here. And I recommend that you know SQL if you're working with I need a data
13:27:43
science job because you're going to have to pull data all the time.
13:27:49
Junior data scientist. Yeah, there's literally no mention of SQL on here.
13:27:55
It's crazy to me. uh e like even think like people that are going to or systems
13:28:00
that have things in place like hey we want to make sure someone has SQL like put it in at least one bullet point
13:28:07
you can see no SQL so this guy got automatically rejected although doesn't look too bad on the side of things you
13:28:14
know you have what happened and then the result associated with it all right let's test another one we're going to
13:28:19
test this one over here with the block letters this is someone out of the USA and we will test it out So let's execute
13:28:26
that workflow. Hopefully this is the correct one and click submit.
13:28:32
This can go through the same thing. I probably should have looked at what happened to the summarization as well. We looked at information extractor like
13:28:38
I had like a masters and things like that. But do that and take a look. This one actually got added to the sheet. So
13:28:45
it says yes and yes. PhD data scientist with eight plus years of experience specialized in machine learning
13:28:51
statistics and large scale biomedical data analysis. proven track record developing novel ML methods and tools
13:28:57
have significantly improved disease biomarker discovery and cancer prediction a lot more over there as well
13:29:03
but I'm not going to read it all and that is a very simple again very simple
13:29:09
this isn't super complicated way to summarize a resume extract information
13:29:15
filter based around it we've added a merge in over here so all this over here
13:29:20
OCR summarization chain information extractor merge filter add to sheets.
13:29:25
You could really see how things are stacking up and why I couldn't show you things like this initially in the beginning, right? But again, just to
13:29:32
kind of recap what we've covered, I still think this one was a little bit more complicated. So, the different
13:29:38
nodes and things like that, basic LM chain essentially, you don't need tools,
13:29:44
you don't need memory. People overuse the AI agent, use the basic LM chain.
13:29:49
Obviously, you saw I did have some issues with the basic LM chain. So if it does not work for you, feel free to
13:29:55
change it into an AI agent. Uh sentiment analysis, you can see things are positive, neutral, or negative.
13:30:01
Typically used in customer reviews or to find what's happening for a specific person or a company. Text classifier,
13:30:08
you know, again, something that you typically will use in some sort of chatbot if you want to route specific
13:30:14
areas on there. Information extractor allows us to grab data from a large
13:30:20
piece of text and give us answers like hey does this person have experience
13:30:25
within this section. You can prompt it to say yes or no or you can say uh search through something and get like a
13:30:31
specific year or things like that and I showed you that there. Summarization chain allows you to do a very quick
13:30:36
summary of a document. There's three different approaches based around that. You have the internal models that have
13:30:43
their own use cases such as like Gemini for video and you can just pull in YouTube video and it'll it'll analyze
13:30:49
it. On that side of things, we have extract text. This is my OCR that I like
13:30:55
using with Mistl. Obviously, other models have OCR as well. I just find Mistrol to work really, really well. And
13:31:01
then we took a look at some examples such as like chaining together uh the basic L and chain. We took a example
13:31:08
over here of finding the sentiment based off of a review and we went different routes associated with it and then we
13:31:15
went through this example of OCR with a resume. Awesome work uh through this
13:31:20
section. If you already learned this, you you probably know more than like 99% of people that even uh touch nan and I
13:31:26
don't know how long this is into the video, but you should be very proud yourself and I will see you guys in the
13:31:32
next section. So, this section is going to cover kind of advanced NEN nodes,
13:31:37
things that I didn't really want to cover a little bit earlier on in the course because they might confuse you and a lot of people use them wrong. This
13:31:44
includes things like the loop node as well as our Python nodes and it's also
13:31:49
going to cover subworkflows. So, let's jump right into it. The first node I want to teach you guys about is the loop
13:31:56
node. I hinted a little bit about it within the API section. So, first let me
13:32:01
show you what the loop node is. So, we're going to go over here to loop and you'll see it says loop over items split
13:32:07
in batches. So, we'll load this up over here and then you can see it says this
13:32:12
is there is a batch size and it says also you may not need this node. Any end nodes automatically run once for each
13:32:18
input item. So, by default it actually gives you this over here. I'm going to
13:32:23
remove this execute workflow and let me explain what is going on. So, first
13:32:30
imagine we have 100 items and I'll just make a sticky note over here to kind of explain it. So, we have 100 items over
13:32:37
here, 100 items over here, right? And then we're going to pass those 100 items
13:32:43
across our workflow. Typically, all 100 items will run in one node. Then it goes to the next node, it runs 100 items.
13:32:49
Then it goes to the next node and runs 100 items. Right? So, let's go over here and just
13:32:55
explain this out. And I I explained this really early on in the course as well. So this is a kind of a good refresher.
13:33:00
So by default we go 100 items, 100 items.
13:33:06
And I feel like this should be better. And it should be 100 items. And you can
13:33:12
imagine each of these are nodes. So that makes sense. Well, what happens with uh
13:33:17
APIs is you get something that's called rate limits. So rate limits like this.
13:33:25
And unfortunately you have to send a specific amount of
13:33:32
data. So some APIs you cannot send 100 items.
13:33:43
This is processing too many requests. And what happens is you'll get some sort
13:33:50
of error message that hey you're having an issue. you cannot send this much data
13:33:55
over there. I had this happen to me with the YouTube transcripts as I showed you. We use a loop over items over there.
13:34:02
Well, the problem was I was sending too much information to Claude when it came to Sonet 45 and I hit limits and because
13:34:09
of that I had to use loop over items. So why you want to use loop over items?
13:34:15
Typically like only if you are using APIs. There's probably a few other use
13:34:22
cases, but people if they don't understand that N works like this, they
13:34:28
think you have to build a whole workflow and just loop over it one item at a time like that. No, it's like it's not like a
13:34:34
for loop in programming where you need to constantly uh loop over things or a while loop. You need and and it goes
13:34:41
node to node. So if you have something that needs to slow down, that's the best
13:34:46
part about loop over items. but only if using or slow down data.
13:34:53
And this is pretty easy because it says replace me. So imagine we just delete this and then we set up an HTTP request.
13:35:01
I'm not going to set up our HTTP request to an API, but imagine we have this
13:35:06
built to an API and we say, "All right, we're going to loop over here. It's
13:35:12
going to run this and it's going to build this out." and you say a batch size of 10. So instead, what this does
13:35:20
is you'll have this going on. Ready? So we'll have our first node. Imagine a
13:35:27
node previous to loop over items. And maybe I'll just set this up. Let's imagine we have an edit set node.
13:35:34
And we have this edit set that goes directly into our loop over items. So our edit set again, fictional world has
13:35:41
100 items. Then we go into our loop over items
13:35:46
which has the input of 100 items. However, we do a batch size of 10. So what it does is 10 runs
13:35:54
of 10 items. So then each time we go into the HTTP request, it only has 10
13:36:00
items.
13:36:07
So hopefully that makes sense. And typically you are not going to just have
13:36:13
the loop over items and HTTP request in there. You're actually going to have one other node and this is really important
13:36:20
to add in and typically you'll do it after the HTTP request. And this is going to be your weight node. So it says
13:36:26
wait before continuing with execution. So why we want to have that is our rate
13:36:32
limits. Just to go back to these notes over here. Rate limits
13:36:38
will tell us how many requests
13:36:44
allowed. And this could be anything from like per second,
13:36:49
it could be per minutes, it could be per hour. Really depends on
13:36:55
the API. And how do you find that out? Once again, and I I preach it all the time.
13:37:02
documentation. And if you don't want to read the documentation, maybe you ask Perplexity,
13:37:07
you ask Claude to read it over. You populate the documentation. But how do you find this out? Documentation. It
13:37:14
will tell you, hey, you can only send 100 requests per minute. And I had this
13:37:21
happen in HubSpot. So, unfortunately, due to the HubSpot nodes, I had to use an HTTP request because they're not
13:37:27
really built out that well yet in any end. If you go over here to HubSpot, there's a lot of them, but for what I
13:37:34
specifically needed, it was not in here. Maybe it is in here now because I built out a workflow about three months ago
13:37:40
with it, but I had to use essentially this. I had a loop over items. I had a
13:37:45
HubSpot uh HTTP request and I I kept sending payloads over to HubSpot just
13:37:52
based off of their requirements. And the funny thing about HubSpot is their rate limits depend on the level of an
13:37:59
account. So the more you pay, the more data you could process, which is not uncommon. As you get into enterprise
13:38:05
software, there's going to be limits based off of your account level. So if you have a lower tier account, you can send less data per minute or per hour.
13:38:12
So something to be aware of. Um, going into this weight node, you can change up
13:38:17
a lot of different settings. So this is the weight amount time. This is in seconds, by the way. And you can change
13:38:24
this to minutes, hours, days as necessary. It's really weird they don't have milliseconds over here as well
13:38:29
because feel like a lot of the nodes in a are based around milliseconds. So when you get into wait and it's like 5
13:38:36
seconds by default, it's kind of interesting especially if you go into uh just to show you our settings over here
13:38:42
and we've covered the retry on fail. You know it's milliseconds. So it's an interesting choice that we have seconds
13:38:50
as the default thing over here instead. I'm just going to turn off the retry by fail. Um, so that is essentially what we
13:38:57
see with loop over items. People way over complicate it. Like they use it for every single workflow. I did not want to
13:39:03
teach you this early on because it's a very bad habit that I see. And I thought this at first because I came from a
13:39:09
programming background. I'm a data scientist full-time. So I write a good amount of loops. And I thought like,
13:39:16
hey, you know what? We're going to need the loop over items for all my workflows. So when I first joined and
13:39:21
learned about Nan, I always used loop over items until I actually learned how items process node to node. And that is
13:39:28
why I I taught that so early on in the course because that is something I wish I knew when I first started any um all
13:39:34
right so that is loop over items that is wait I want to show you also the
13:39:41
different code nodes on this side of things. Now this isn't going to be a full Python tutorial. In fact, um I'm
13:39:47
kind of thinking for my next very long video, I just teach you guys everything I know about Python or like Python
13:39:55
pandas or something like that. But uh we're going to jump into our code node.
13:40:00
And right now in nan you have two different programming languages that you could use. You could use JavaScript or
13:40:07
you could use Python. And right now I would say if you had to learn just one
13:40:13
language for any end focus on JavaScript. Now I don't have a
13:40:18
JavaScript background because in data a lot of programming is done in Python and
13:40:25
SQL. So I know Python. I don't know JavaScript. That's going to change next year. I actually want to learn a little
13:40:31
bit about JavaScript. I think it would be helpful for any N and I think there's other applications for it that I should
13:40:36
learn about it. However, if you your only focus is to learn a programming language for NAN, go JavaScript. If your
13:40:43
focus is to expand out of NAN and you want to learn AI outside of this, if you
13:40:49
want to learn how to analyze data, if you want to possibly become a programmer, I would recommend using
13:40:56
Python. So, two different routes. Personally, I will still say probably go the Python route just because one, I'm
13:41:03
biased, but I think eventually everything that's going to be in JavaScript will be in Python and nan and
13:41:09
it's only like a few weird use cases that there's no Python available, but and I think it's like with the sort
13:41:15
node. If I remember correctly, if I go to sort, you can see code, this is only JavaScript. So, it's weird that you
13:41:22
can't change the sort node into Python. Um, well, next time I talk to any hand team, I'll bring that up. However, um
13:41:29
there's weird cases like that where JavaScript is probably the better approach, whereas Python, you can't use
13:41:35
that, but I would just recommend learning how to use Python because I think there's a ton of applications
13:41:40
there. And I think you could if you're going into like a full-time job, I think Python probably pays a little bit higher
13:41:47
than JavaScript just based off of what is needed. You see software developers using Python, you see data scientists
13:41:52
using Python, data engineers, data analysts. So there's a lot of applications out over there. A lot of AI
13:41:58
packages out there also use Python if you know how to use it. So um yeah, I like that. Anyways, not to not to go on
13:42:04
a full rant. So by default, you'll see that we have an ask AI. So we could ask
13:42:09
in here directly, hey, how do I build out this code? And the same thing with
13:42:15
Python. And I want to give you guys a heads up. A lot of people what they're going to do is go straight into the code
13:42:22
node and go into chat gpt or claude and ask like hey can you um build out all
13:42:30
this code in one code node and skip other additional nodes and we've we spent a lot of time talking about nodes
13:42:37
like the summarize node and aggregations and things like that and if you go back
13:42:42
over here and go to data transformations a lot of these data transformations whether it's like a a split out or
13:42:49
aggregate or a merge like people try to do this in the Python code node or the JavaScript node and it's like use the
13:42:55
native nodes when possible. So one of the mistakes that people use is they'll they'll try to stuff too much
13:43:01
information into a Python code node. They um vibe code at all. They don't understand what the code actually does
13:43:08
and it just becomes a mess. So do not do that. Only use the code node when you
13:43:15
have to when you have no other choices in nan and you're like I'm stuck. I can't figure out what to do next. Use
13:43:21
the code node edition. You're like okay um should I ask AI in here? Should I?
13:43:28
And it's interesting there's no ask AI on the Python side. I just I didn't notice that. Look, you have the ask AI
13:43:33
for JavaScript. Don't have ask AI over here. Weird. Either way, um, one other
13:43:41
benefit, oh, sorry. I was gonna say for building out this code, what I recommend, and obviously things change,
13:43:48
so take this with a grain of salt because if you look over how AI changed in all of 2025, um, what things people
13:43:55
recommended in January might have changed by the end of the year. Claude Code is phenomenal. So, I use that for
13:44:02
generating code. Like, it's really, really nice. I use Sonnet 45 as well. It just like I think it does a great job.
13:44:09
It understands what's happening. I as I showed you guys and I'll show it again. I have a screenshot over here and I
13:44:15
populated. One other thing to mention with both these code nodes and again I'll I'll show you some basic use cases.
13:44:22
These are great for building out example data. Now earlier in the code in the course we built out example data with
13:44:29
our edit set. So we go over here and let's say we have name and I'll just put Ryan over here. Well, the thing with
13:44:36
code node is you can actually build out like 10 names at once and I didn't mean to actually run the code node, but you
13:44:42
can see we have output of one item and that's kind of a limitation of edit set. So you can see like okay well we build
13:44:47
out one and I showed you we could build out an array and split this out or break it out and have multiple items. Well, we
13:44:53
could do this directly in any n and let me show you how we could do this. Um, so
13:45:00
I'm just going to copy over an example I already did in my Python video. So, don't kill me on that one. I try to make
13:45:05
a lot of the different stuff here um differently. But you can see over here, all I'm doing is return. I'm returning
13:45:11
this JSON. I have a name for each of these people and then I have a salary. And take a look. Now, what we have is we
13:45:19
have five items. So, if you want to test with multiple items, the code node is
13:45:24
phenomenal for that. You could do the same thing in JavaScript. You just have to grab uh you just have to essentially
13:45:30
give an example. And I again I like I mostly build out in Python rather than JavaScript. So applicable to each of
13:45:37
these languages and uh I find it great for testing because now we've built out five items and we can test a workflow
13:45:43
based around it. Whereas in our edit set we only have one. So if you need multiple items to test code node
13:45:50
otherwise you go into here and just to explain this code what we're doing is returning a JSON object. We have name
13:45:56
over here. We paired all these over here to name. So you can see Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana, and Eve. And then we set
13:46:02
up salaries. Uh there's a lot of other things that we could do within the Python code node. So you can actually do
13:46:09
math in here, which I find that to be pretty good. Um math when you're going into like edit set and some of the other
13:46:15
stuff can be a little bit wonky. So I find it easier to do it within the code node at times. Also, if you want to add
13:46:22
in a new um column for all these items, I find it easier to do it in Python.
13:46:29
And literally all you have to do to add in a new column, and I'll just like add in a new code node. So, I'll just grab
13:46:35
Python over here. Let's go to Python.
13:46:40
And uh I'll just show you this really quick. All you got to do is this.
13:46:47
I'm just again I'm just grabbing over some code I already have. And it's actually very Oh, it's actually
13:46:52
literally the same as this over here. So, I guess I could have just explained it with that, but it's fine. So, all we
13:46:59
do is we create the new column name. So, you can see in the example code, it says my new field. And this one that I built
13:47:04
out, I called this status, and I set this equal to process by default. You can see my new field is equal to one.
13:47:10
So, if I run this, all of these are going to have a new field that says my new field with one. And this is the
13:47:15
default code it gives you out of the box. So it shows you essentially how to build out a new column for everything which again I find this very helpful if
13:47:22
you want to start this out and obviously you can build out logic just from this for loop and really expand this out
13:47:28
where each of these could have different values associated with it. I want to say I have an example of that over here as
13:47:34
well. Um let me just double check. Maybe not.
13:47:41
Think I did though. Oh here we go. Here's another example of that. So let
13:47:46
me just show you this code. So again, we're using the same structure. So you can see the four item and items. This is
13:47:51
going to stay the same. We're returning items at the very end as well. So keep that the same. And then all you have to
13:47:56
do is write the code here in the middle. So what I'm doing is I'm grabbing the salary for each of these items. And then
13:48:02
I'm creating a new category based off the salary level. So if I say they're greater than 80,000, senior, mid-level,
13:48:09
junior. If I run this step over here, you'll see all these are different. So
13:48:14
you know we have the different approaches. We can build out something by default again just go into Python code node and
13:48:21
assign all the values over there which this is the example over here. All we do
13:48:26
is create a new field and put the value. Again super super easy or we can go in
13:48:32
and um have different customization based off of this. I find if lf else is
13:48:37
probably the easiest route to go. Obviously, there's a lot that I could teach you with Python programming
13:48:43
video for another day. And obviously, like you can go and use this structure and ask Claude. So, just to show you,
13:48:53
if I wanted to ask Claude, for example, I'm just going to go into our code node.
13:49:01
I don't know, we could ask a question based around this. over here based on this
13:49:08
this nan code structure.
13:49:15
Can you modify this? So there is five holes. Like this is a
13:49:20
super e easy coding request. But I would just recommend you take a
13:49:26
screenshot of everything that is going on. Your input, your code, your output.
13:49:32
And then look, it says look at your end code. I can modify five levels. Here is the updated Python code. So we have all
13:49:38
this over here. We can just copy this in. Again, super super basic. You don't need um code node over here for that.
13:49:45
And now you can see we have senior mid-level, junior entry level. And we have all that on that side of things.
13:49:51
This look good. So intern under 30,000, entry level over 30, junior over 50, mid-level over 70, and senior over 90.
13:49:59
Pretty basic. Great. And again, everything is applicable in JavaScript. I don't know
13:50:04
JavaScript as well as I know Python. So um I probably explained things a few a bit wrong and I don't want to do that
13:50:10
this particular video. But you know you can use a large language model. All
13:50:16
right. Uh last thing I wanted to cover really fast is uh the call nan workflow
13:50:21
tool and sub workflow nodes. So let's cover that in this section. And what
13:50:27
we're going to do is call or execute subworkflow.
13:50:34
Great. So we'll have that over here. We'll also
13:50:40
add in an AI agent. Grab that as well.
13:50:46
Pass that in. And then we're going to go and look for workflow as well. You can see at the very top call any workflow
13:50:53
tool. All right. So, let's explain all of these. Oh, I want to go to execute
13:51:00
workflow trigger here as well. Great. So we're going to explain all
13:51:06
three of these and we're so essentially what we can do in our NAN workflow is
13:51:12
call another workflow. So imagine you have logic that you essentially are
13:51:18
going to use in multiple workflows or it's very complicated logic and you would rather just simplify your workflow
13:51:24
and have that complicated logic in one area. Well, one way that you could do this is through the execute workflow uh
13:51:31
node or as well as a tool. So what are the differences? Well, this is going to
13:51:36
be in the middle of the orchestration layer. So you have some sort of input that comes in over here. Then we execute that workflow. Whatever happens in that
13:51:43
workflow, then it comes back into this node and then it processes along the way. This actually changed a little bit
13:51:51
between version one of Nan as well as version two. Um they the N any team
13:51:56
really beefed this up so that way you could use a little bit more human in the loop and make it much easier and which
13:52:01
is why we're going to have a full section on this. But essentially all you need to know for this over here for the
13:52:07
execute workflow is you can have another workflow essentially inside your workflow. So, imagine what we had over
13:52:14
here is a imagine we had an AI agent.
13:52:22
And I'm I'm building things on the fly, so I'm not like really thinking about what we're doing, but imagine we had some sort of AI agent that goes right
13:52:29
into a code node. Let's say code JavaScript that goes into
13:52:35
an edit set that goes into um let's go to data
13:52:41
transformations. Let's say we go to split. Again, none of this makes any sense at all. Um, actually, let's do one
13:52:48
more data transformation. We're going to do is we're going to do an aggregate before we go to that node over here.
13:52:55
All right, I'm just thinking on the fly right here. But imagine we wanted to have this like
13:53:01
we think this is very complicated logic. We're going to use this logic over again, multiple workflows. Let's send
13:53:06
this to another workflow. So you could replace all that with this node. And the
13:53:14
easiest way to replace this in a workflow is if you highlight all this, you rightclick and then what we have the
13:53:20
option to is over here. Convert five nodes to subworkflow. So what we'll say
13:53:26
over here is section 20 subworkflow
13:53:32
part two just because that way I can let you guys uh download this and mess with it. But you'll see now we have that all
13:53:39
replaced with this node. And you're like, "All right, that's cool. What happened?" So click over here, open a
13:53:44
new tab, and take a look. So now what we have is this start trigger, which you
13:53:49
need to connect this over here. And then it has our entire workflow. We already renamed this section 20 sub workflow
13:53:55
part two. But now we have this whole workflow in essentially its own blank canvas. And now all of that junk has
13:54:03
been cleaned up into one uh particular node. It's very very helpful on this
13:54:08
side of things. And this trigger starts it. So whenever we hit that node, we go
13:54:14
into this workflow, it runs. Once it hits that very last node, it comes back over here into this node and it keeps
13:54:21
moving forward. So kind of like the part two of this is you can do this with an AI agent as well. So imagine you want
13:54:28
your AI agent to have access to a workflow that you already built like hey this AI agent is going to process data
13:54:34
and you know what it should access this workflow over here because it goes through that entire process I want the AI agent to do well that's where the N
13:54:42
workflow tool is. So you can go over here and it says call this tool to get a random color the input should be a string with comma separated by colors to
13:54:48
exclude. So, you want to fill this out with details to let your AI agent know explicitly, hey, this is what's going on
13:54:56
in this workflow. This is why you need to call it. And you should also, as I
13:55:02
mentioned in our AI agent lesson, you need to explicitly write that in the system message. When should it access
13:55:08
this tool? So, you need to say the description over here. When should it access this workflow? You need to make
13:55:14
sure you write this here. Make sure the names are one, two, one. I would rename this instead of call any end workflow
13:55:19
tool to whatever thing that you want it to be. So if your workflow generates a random color, call this random number or
13:55:25
random color generator. Define that in here as well. It's so important that you
13:55:31
do that it because otherwise you're going to get hallucinations. Sometimes it's not going to call the specific tool
13:55:36
that you want it to do. So be as explicit as possible. So again to kind
13:55:41
of recap what is going on over here. First, you can replace multiple nodes
13:55:47
with this execute subworkflow. So, you can see it says execute workflow over here. So, if you have repeated logic
13:55:53
that you're going to use in multiple workflows and you want to control in one place so that way you don't have to update it multiple times, this is
13:56:00
helpful over here. Or if you have something very complicated and you're like, this is just taking up too much space on my screen. And obviously, like
13:56:06
that five node example isn't really too complicated. I don't know if that's five or six nodes, but sometimes when when
13:56:12
you're building out real world workflows for customers, you might have 20 or 30 nodes and you're like, well, you know, a
13:56:17
lot of this might be easier done with the execute subworkflow. Um, maybe you want to go that approach. In addition,
13:56:23
it'll go all over here and we can run that. You can also see your executions
13:56:28
on the side of things. So, you will be able to see your executions in the sub workflow as well as your actual
13:56:34
workflow. Uh, one of the best benefits of our execute workflow like this, well, there's two benefits. The first one is
13:56:41
we can use human in the loop, which we're going to talk about in two sections. The other thing that's this is
13:56:46
really helpful for is parallel processing. So, we haven't really talked about that too much, but parallel
13:56:53
processing is a way to optimize the speed of your workflows. Sometimes people have very slow workflows and
13:57:00
you'll want to essentially parallel process so they run quite faster. I'll show you that here in a second, how we
13:57:06
could utilize that. Um, but that would be the other benefit. So, we'll cover that here in a second. In addition,
13:57:11
right, when we go into our AI agent, what we're going to do is use a call any workflow tool if we want to have that
13:57:17
agent access a specific workflow. You could also set up multiple workflows to talk to our AI agent. Just remember what
13:57:24
you need to do is have a workflow that starts with this execute subworkflow and that can be called by either this tool
13:57:31
or it can be called by this node. And you can see over here it says source
13:57:36
like where we looking for um the workflow specifically. So this has the section 20 sub workflow part two. And
13:57:43
then you have different modes is you can run once for each item or you can run once for all items. So the difference is
13:57:49
is run once for all items pass all items into a single execution of the sub workflow called the nan sub workflow for
13:57:55
for each specific item. So this goes back into what I was talking about with how items are processed. So, do you want
13:58:01
all 100 items directly into that subworkflow or do you want one item at a
13:58:07
time to go through that sub workflow? It really depends on your specific use case and if you're going to use human in the
13:58:13
loop or not. All right, some other settings over here as well. And you can wait for the sub workflow to complete or
13:58:19
you can have this continue to go forward. So what that means is like hey should we wait for all 100 items to be
13:58:25
processed by this or as soon as one is done we should go back over here and
13:58:31
continue on the workflow like the extra nodes that are after. So that is going to be that option over there. Um the
13:58:37
call any end workflow tool you can see we have the same exact thing. We just put the description. Uh let's say for
13:58:43
example we do the section 20 and it says a sub workflow tool set up to receive all input data. Without specific inputs
13:58:48
the agent will not be able to pass data to the tool. You can define specific inputs in a subworkflow trigger. So if
13:58:53
we go over to that trigger just to show you over here, we can define input data mode. So you can either accept all data,
13:59:00
you could accept specific fields. So you can define what fields it should expect or you could use JSON as an example of
13:59:07
what to accept in this sub workflow. And I know we're not really doing an example over here, but when we jump into human
13:59:15
in the loop, it's going to be a lot more explicit on what we are doing over there. you're just going to have to wait
13:59:20
one more section. So, in general, what we covered first, um, again, loop over
13:59:26
items, you don't always need the loop over items. Just use it when you're using APIs and you're getting rate
13:59:31
limited. Not even all APIs are needed loop over items. You'll just, if you're sending a lot of data over and you're
13:59:36
having issues, loop over items, use the HTTP request or the native node, and then use a weight. You can decide what
13:59:42
the batch size is. So, if you want to send one item, 10 items, 100 items. And how you find out this information is
13:59:49
based off of the documentation. Look at the rate limits. So you'll have to change what's the loop and then what's
13:59:55
also the weight. And obviously like you would want to try to optimize the batch size. A larger batch size um with maybe
14:00:01
a a larger weight is better because I do find any and bugs out when you get into like over 100 200 300 executions at
14:00:09
times um through the loop over items. It's it can be a little bit funky. So try to optimize both of those. And then
14:00:16
we talked about the code node. So JavaScript and Python obviously if you want to learn and get better NE I'd
14:00:21
focus on one of the two really if you want to grow your career I would recommend Python although JavaScript is
14:00:26
a little bit more powerful in N. You can use this to generate items as well for testing which I highly recommend. I do
14:00:33
that all the time. It's super easy to do in JavaScript as well. Then we talked about the sub workflows. So you can use
14:00:40
the subworkflow tool or you can use the execute workflow node. Um, and then there's a trigger in that separate
14:00:45
workflow. You can rightclick and jump into that. We'll talk about this more in human in loop. And that is going to be
14:00:50
section 20. Uh, we're going to change it up a little bit before we jump into human loop. We're going to actually talk about multimodal, which is going to be
14:00:57
generating images and videos. I will see you there. Now, so this next section is going to be focused on generating images
14:01:03
and videos with AI. Now, I will say the workflow we're going to be using today,
14:01:09
I have built this out in a previous video, but I'm going to go through every single step and walk with you guys
14:01:14
through um why I built it and how we can build it together. In addition, we're
14:01:20
going to be talking about a marketplace that I use for gathering different image and video models. Image and video models
14:01:28
are changing rapidly. So, literally probably a month after this video, people's preferences for models are
14:01:34
going to change. So obviously use what's popular. This is a framework to get started. Feel free to tweak the
14:01:40
workflow. Feel free to tweak how you approach this. So let me jump into there. This is the workflow which we're
14:01:47
going to be building. It's pretty easy. And yeah, we're using we're taking a
14:01:52
look at a website called i.aii. And you can see that there's like popular video models like VO31 or Sora 2
14:02:00
Sora 2 watermark. Or if you go back into the first page, there's some of these other newer models. Like GPT Image 15, I
14:02:06
want to say came out like a week ago. I haven't used it yet. I use Nano Banana Pro quite a bit. And you can see it says
14:02:13
starting from 9 cents, which is really cheap. This one doesn't say where it's starting from. This Z image is very
14:02:19
cheap. Look at how cheap that is. Um, Cream is pretty cheap as well. So, we'll
14:02:25
jump into some of these. You can actually generate stuff as well directly in here. So this is an example that they
14:02:31
give you. Change your clothing to a blue evening gown. Reserve face, identity,
14:02:36
hairstyle. And you can see the background is nearly identical and all you did is change the image. A nano
14:02:42
banana. It shows you essentially a graphic that was created. Although I find it really great for UGC creators.
14:02:49
And then BO3 generates videos. So you can generate videos like vertically or
14:02:54
horizontally. So vertically for like a Tik Tok or Instagram, horizontally like this if you're going to get like B-roll
14:03:01
for a YouTube video. And again, I've used these for YouTube videos and YouTube thumbnails and and things like
14:03:07
that. So these are actually quite easy to set up here in Nan. I'm going to
14:03:13
essentially reproduce this for you guys step by step just to show you how to do this. Um we can also just go over here
14:03:20
and generate something. So this is an example that was generated just by text.
14:03:26
This again wasn't something that I created but something that's already populated over here. And the prompt that
14:03:31
this person used is create a photo realalistic candid photograph of an elderly sailor standing on a small
14:03:37
fishing boat. He has weathered skin with visible wrinkles, pores and sun texture and a few faded. A traditional sailor
14:03:44
tattoos on his arm. He's commonly adjusting a net while his dog sits nearby on a dock. Shot like a 35
14:03:50
millimeter film. Photography medium close-up at eye level. Use a 50 millimeter lens. The image should feel
14:03:55
honest and unposed with real skin texture, worn materials, and everyday detail. No glimmerization or heavy
14:04:01
retouching. And this is like a very good photo. I mean, this looks realistic. I mean, it's phenomenal.
14:04:07
One thing you'll notice is there's a lot of detail in this prompt, right? We talk
14:04:13
about the close-up. We talk about what the person should look like. We talk about the boat. We talk about the dog.
14:04:20
So, when it comes to like building out really good image or video, a lot of this is dependent on your prompts. And
14:04:28
there's so much that you could cover with prompts. You could talk about lighting, you could talk about angles, you could talk about and video side of
14:04:36
things. You could talk about the audio. You could talk about transitions. You could talk about the type of camera
14:04:41
shot. Like, is it a close and zooms out or does it start far away and zoom in?
14:04:46
You can talk about the exact conversation that multiple people or one person says. Uh you could literally
14:04:53
build out kind of meme videos with like yetis and snowmen and there's so much that you could do with prompts, but
14:05:01
really you just got to describe it. Think of yourself as the filmmaker and what type of shot do you want? Give as
14:05:07
much detail as possible. We'll say hallucinations do happen so be wary of
14:05:13
that. So, you can see the cost on this is like very cheap. It's bore to run this. And just to show you the pricing,
14:05:21
I think I mentioned in this take, but I've spent about $50 on here. Um, and
14:05:26
you can see billing over here. You get $50 for 10,000 credits. So, the fact that this is available at four credits
14:05:33
is super cheap. Uh, you can change the quality medium or high as well. And actually, I'm shocked that this didn't
14:05:40
Oh, there we go. I'm like, that seems very cheap for four credits. uh medium and high but you can see high
14:05:47
is way more expensive. I don't know if this is the medium quality or not but there is that and you can see our
14:05:53
results JSON we have this image over here as a WEBP file. So pretty easy to
14:05:59
set up. First show you where you can get your API key at. So all you have to want to
14:06:06
do is go to API keys over here and create a new key. copy the key because
14:06:11
we will be utilizing that here in a second. So how this workflow operates
14:06:17
first what we want to do is in this case I am going to use a Google sheet and um
14:06:24
I'm essentially documenting what workflows I want to have built out. So I'm not going to show this because this
14:06:30
is part of a customer project but I'm kind of bulking out images that I want
14:06:36
to create. I put like 15 images in this spreadsheet just based off of prompts
14:06:41
because I'm going to pass them forward. Next thing I'm going to do is set up two HTTP requests. And this is just based
14:06:49
off of the documentation. So documentation just to go into there. Let me grab this
14:06:56
for this old man. Go into our API. You can see we have
14:07:02
different information that we specifically need. And it says all APIs require authentication v via a bearer
14:07:08
token. And essentially all I did is go over
14:07:14
here and copy the curl. And if you take a look, there's an import curl section.
14:07:20
We took over this in the API section, but literally just copy and paste it. I set up a header off based off of the API
14:07:26
key. So in the past, it was populating in here, but I just set up a header off.
14:07:32
And to show you, all I did is call authorization and paste that API key that we saved a little bit earlier.
14:07:40
And then based off the model, it's going to ask you to send a specific body. So
14:07:45
what you can see is for example over here,
14:07:50
go to the body. It says model, you have the string over here, call back, and then input. So input parameter
14:07:57
is based off the form configuration. So there's going to be probably some examples over here.
14:08:03
We go to examples. All right. And then we just jump into the examples. So you can see like input
14:08:10
prompt, you have all this over here. You have input aspect ratio, you have input
14:08:15
quality. So those are your three options that you can choose. You put your prompt, you put your aspect ratio, and
14:08:20
then you put in your quality. So you can see for this example for nano banana what I put over here is I use the model
14:08:27
there's the callback URL and then input as a prompt and I just passed in JSON
14:08:32
for this based around um what it was in that specific spreadsheet. This one you
14:08:38
had the option to choose an aspect ratio for GPT image. I don't think you have that option. Let me just go over here.
14:08:45
Oh no you have the option you have 1x 1, 2x3 or 3x two. So you could define that
14:08:50
here in the model resolution I nanobin 4K but this one would have the quality.
14:08:56
So you just change it up for medium or high and then output format option I don't believe over here. So it
14:09:03
will automatically give that to you based off here. But honestly it's literally just reading the documentation
14:09:09
and to show you like if I was going to set this up we'll go build out HTTP. So HTP request
14:09:20
like that and let's go through it. So API
14:09:27
let's find our curl. So this is the request example. We're going to copy that curl.
14:09:33
Go over here for curl. Paste.
14:09:40
Great. And you can see obviously we have this barrier API key. Again, I just set this up directly in over here instead.
14:09:48
So, I just created a header off. So, make sure authentication generic credential type
14:09:54
header off and then create a new one, which I did. Create new credential ki AI. So, literally just create new
14:10:01
credential and um you can see I called this authorization with a capital A, paste in
14:10:07
my API key. That's all you got to do. authorization, past in your API key.
14:10:14
Everything else is already filled out and going down over here. All you need to do is change up a few
14:10:20
things like you don't need to change up your model if you're using GPT15 image. You don't need to change this. You just
14:10:26
change your prompt. You change the aspect ratio to how you want it as well as the quality. Like three things. And
14:10:32
you can pass in JSON with an expression if you want to define that a little bit earlier. Next side of it, so this is a
14:10:38
little bit funky. This is something called pulling and um essentially what we're trying to do over here is wait for
14:10:44
the image to be generated or the video in your case. So because of that you
14:10:49
know sometimes it might take 30 seconds for aage to be created. Sometimes it might take three or four vid minutes for
14:10:54
a video to be created. So we have a wait node over here. We're waiting 30 seconds. Obviously like you can increase
14:11:01
it decrease it. I would recommend at least 30 seconds. And then we have a second HTTP request. This time we do a
14:11:07
get. The reason why is with this first one, which I skipped over it, but it's a a post. We're using
14:11:14
post to create the image or video and then we're using get to grab those specific results. Again, use the same
14:11:21
header off and why I recommend just doing this also for security purposes so you don't share your API key. And then
14:11:27
what you're going to do is paste in a task ID over here. You'll get your task ID from the first run. So you'll see I
14:11:35
have a task ID over here. So, make sure that you paste it in on the side of
14:11:40
things. Really, it's pretty basic. All you got to do is grab this URL,
14:11:46
which is the record info. Put in a task ID. And again, I just did
14:11:52
this with curl initially, but you can see get task. And this is the request. Like, honestly, you don't really need
14:11:57
the curl request. Just get that URL. This is the same as before. And then
14:12:04
just send in the task ID. It's JSON. Then I have a switch. So all we're
14:12:10
taking a look at is the data state. It might be a little bit different depending on the model. But when I hit success, it'll go over here. Otherwise,
14:12:18
if it's not ready, it'll repopulate. And if there's an error, I just set that as a fallback. So sometimes there is errors
14:12:24
based off of guidelines of the model. So sometimes if you put something that's in that gray area, Google or OpenAI might
14:12:32
reject it. Otherwise, usually it's pretty good. But there's some guidelines, too. Like if you use a
14:12:37
famous figure, um it's not going to work. Then what I did next is just test
14:12:42
this out. So I have the generated image as a specific uh link over here.
14:12:50
I just updated this into a spreadsheet. Now, I could go a few different routes.
14:12:55
Like I could download this image, have it as a binary file, and then upload this into Google Drive if I really
14:13:01
wanted to. And that honestly might be the version two of this. We're just doing some testing based around this right now. And um yeah, again it's a
14:13:09
very similar setup you're using image or video models. Another thing that people tend to use quite a bit is they'll
14:13:16
generate the image first. Make sure the image is great and then use that image for a video. So like you can imagine
14:13:23
this old man over here. Someone might create this guy as a UGC
14:13:28
creator. And we'll go back over here to text image. Like this literally might be a
14:13:34
UGC creator and someone creates a video about it. And maybe we'll just test this
14:13:39
out really quick just to show you. So if I go over here, I'm going to say image to video. And this is a little bit
14:13:46
different for video side of things.
14:13:53
All right. And I have the old man over here. And I'm just gonna say, and I I honestly don't have audio on this
14:13:59
computer unless my Bluetooth is out, so I can't hear what it's saying. I'm just gonna say have the old command hold up a
14:14:08
sign saying subscribe to Ryan
14:14:16
Science. We'll spend the 60 tokens or whatever it is for this. This is image to video.
14:14:23
Like there's a lot of things that you could do. with this over here. So you can see you can do text to video just straight up
14:14:29
prompted which by the way you can also do JSON for this side of things. We have image to video and then references to
14:14:35
video where like if you have four or five different images actually I believe it's up to only three on here but if you
14:14:40
have three different images and you want to turn it into a video the weird thing is like image to video and text to video you could have it vertical. Uh the
14:14:47
reference is the video you cannot have this vertical as of yet. So it's very common someone creates a static image
14:14:53
first. You can use a Nano Banana Pro or GPT15 or one of the other models out
14:14:59
there. And then what people will do is use that image and put it into a video
14:15:04
model kind of like uh VO31 which we have over here. Now this is at 18%. I'm just
14:15:10
going to pause really fast and when this hits 100% we'll be right back.
14:15:15
All right, so the video is ready. Let's see what ends up happening. Again, this is like a a pretty terrible prompt and I
14:15:21
would recommend building out a way better one, but I I can't hear what the audio is on at the moment unless I turn
14:15:28
on my speaker. And at the end of day, this is just a use case just to share it with you guys. So, we have the old man,
14:15:33
he's doing fishing and then take a look. Subscribe to Ryan in math data science.
14:15:40
So, obviously that's a hallucination. And you know, the sign could be a little
14:15:46
bit better, but at the end of the day, this was very poor prompt. And uh I would
14:15:52
probably run it again and describe what the sign should look like, how he holds the sign, things like that. But just to
14:15:58
show you and uh the API on this side of it for V31, a little bit different. You
14:16:03
can see the screen on this side of it. And you have more options. So I'm going
14:16:10
over here you can see you have your prompts you have your image urls you have your model
14:16:17
generation type aspect ratio seeds so this is the randomness of the
14:16:24
video call back urls enable fallback like there's a lot more over here than
14:16:29
just the image side of it but it's honestly not too bad so you can download this full workflow
14:16:36
as well and feel free to test this out. Why I do this is like you don't want to wait a minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes for
14:16:42
every single video. So, it's better off just to have a spreadsheet, build out that spreadsheet based off of what you
14:16:48
want, run through the workflow, and uh append the very end, but feel free to
14:16:53
tweak it for Google Drive. So, if you remembered anything from this video, it's super easy to build out AI
14:16:59
generated images and videos. You could do it manually on Kai or other services, or you can bulk it in nan. In addition,
14:17:06
be super specific with the prompts. The more specific you are and calling out like the type of shots and the type of
14:17:12
audio, the better results that you are going to have. I talked about prompting for videos for like well over an hour in
14:17:18
another video. So, if you want to watch that, go ahead. I'm not going to waste you guys time for the hour there. And uh
14:17:25
that is the end of this lecture. Next lesson we're going to be doing is talking about something called human in
14:17:32
the loop. So essentially AI creates something and then you have to approve it before it is finalized. A lot of
14:17:38
companies want to have human in the loop within their workflows. Um I know my company has a slogan for that
14:17:44
specifically as do others. So it'll be kind of exciting to cover that and I will see you right there. This section
14:17:51
is going to focus on human in the loop. It might be a buzz word that you have heard before and let me explain what
14:17:58
this is. So a lot of different companies are going to have some sort of regulation where they say, "Hey, we like
14:18:04
things that are generated by AI. AI is awesome. But before we actually publish the content that AI has created, can we
14:18:11
have a human review it?" And the thing about it is why companies have this in place, AI tends to hallucinate. And this
14:18:19
will be a way to just have another fail safe in the system before you publish something. Let's say, for example,
14:18:25
you're going to be creating some sort of image when you want to post it on your social media accounts. Well, sometimes
14:18:31
when you're doing image creation, text isn't going to be 100% accurate. You'll have some gibberish on a sign or
14:18:37
something like that or you create some sort of graphic and there's just a weird spot and you shouldn't publish this.
14:18:43
Well, without human in the loop, you generate something in AI, you automate it and it gets sent automatically to
14:18:48
LinkedIn or Twitter. It makes your company look bad. So instead of automatically posting something, we have
14:18:54
a reviewer that takes a look at it, says, "Hey, this is awesome and this is good to go." And then it gets sent out.
14:19:00
And because of this process and it's being used so often, there's a whole section of nodes within any called human
14:19:08
in the loop. Today, we're going to be covering some of these different types of nodes and show you an example
14:19:14
workflow. A workflow we're going to use is based off of the workflow from the last lecture. So, we're going to
14:19:19
generate an image, then we're going to send out an email and have someone approve of the image or not, and then
14:19:26
work from there. And yeah, let's take a look at it right now. Okay, so what I
14:19:32
did is I imported in our workflow from the last lesson and I actually put in
14:19:37
one additional item and that is this send a message. So, let's kind of walk
14:19:43
through what is going on in this node and where I found this. All right. So, you click this plus icon over here and
14:19:49
you'll notice that we have human in the loop and it says wait for approval or human input before continuing. And then
14:19:55
you'll see all the different human in the loop notes. So, we have Discord, we have Gmail, we have Google chat,
14:20:00
outlook, teams, respond to chat, send email, Slack, Telegram, as well as WhatsApp Business Cloud. So, you know,
14:20:08
it would take a long time to cover each of these. And I'll be honest with you guys, I don't even have credentials set up for Outlook or Teams. Slack is on my
14:20:16
backlog and I haven't used Telegram before although I should because it's really really popular. We're going to go
14:20:21
through the Gmail example over here. But you can imagine like if you use Slack, you'll get a message in Slack and I'll
14:20:28
just show you the Slack node here for a second. You get a message and send or wait for a response. You can specify the
14:20:34
message and you can set a response type. So obviously there's different settings
14:20:39
for each of these particular nodes. I want to show you the Gmail one over here. So, what we have in this Gmail
14:20:45
note, I literally just connect to my Gmail account, which all of you guys should know how to do by now. I'm
14:20:50
sending it to my personal email and I have a subject approval required. Please review. You can obviously set a subject
14:20:56
as you want. I think this is fine. I said, "Hello, please review the following request." And click the approve button and I send in image. Now,
14:21:03
this is the image that's getting generated by this workflow. You can't pass in binary data over here. So, I'm
14:21:09
passing in a link that will pass into the image. You might have to use a B 64 or something like that otherwise, but I
14:21:16
think this is pretty fine. And I say thank you. Also, then we go into the
14:21:21
response type. So, this says approval. And let me show you what approval looks like. So, in my email, you'll see that
14:21:27
this looks like I don't know why this didn't go full screen. Oops. Let me uh move this over here. It's getting caught
14:21:35
up in my monitor. There we go. All right. So, you can see this is an
14:21:40
example. Hello, please review the following request and click the approve button and you can click that approve and it says automated with any n over
14:21:47
there. So that's approval by default. But that's not the only option. You have
14:21:52
free text. So user can submit a response via a form and you could set that up also or you could have a custom form
14:21:58
where you define below. Let's keep it as approval. And then you can see there's currently no items exist under the
14:22:04
options. Well, you have a few different options as well. So you can do approve only or you can set approve and
14:22:11
disapprove. So you can change the label buttons as well. Approve is the primary,
14:22:16
decline is the secondary. You obviously could switch these as well. And what's cool is when you have that built in, you
14:22:23
can just set a decline and etc. Then we have also over here, let me go back in
14:22:29
other options. You have a limit wait time. So, you can set a specific amount of time that you should get a response
14:22:34
back, which is helpful. You can set like this as 45 minutes. You can say hours,
14:22:40
you could say days. I probably wouldn't recommend days on that side of things, especially in a corporate environment. You might want to just have it as like
14:22:46
45 minutes. I think this is pretty appropriate. And then you could pin that any attribution. Honestly, I would keep
14:22:51
that NAN attribution automated with NAN, but you can turn that off if you particularly want it to. So, let me show
14:22:58
you this example of approve and disapprove. So, we're just going to use the same thing that we have over here
14:23:04
for a generated image. And actually, I'm going to pin this data point. So, I don't want to do this all over again.
14:23:11
And I'm going to click on this. You'll see our node is running like this very slowly. And hopefully, we do get an
14:23:17
email. Now, I'm going to check my Gmail account and I will load this up.
14:23:23
All right. So, now we have the email and it says, "Hello, please review the following request." and click the
14:23:30
approve button. We have the image. So, this image over here, just to show you what it looks like, all I did is
14:23:35
generate a UGC creator promoting a watch. So, we have that over there. It looks like there's like a branded cup.
14:23:42
So, maybe I don't want to have that in on that side of things. But either way, we have an image. And you know what? You
14:23:47
can approve it or disprove it. So, I'm going to click over here and click approve. And it says got it. Thanks.
14:23:52
This page can be closed. Now, I'm going back over here. You'll see it says one item sent out. And then it says
14:23:59
approved. So what you can also do is based off of this being approved or not, you can go over and set an if node and
14:24:07
you can route based around that. Now I wish this was natively built into this human in the loop node, but that's okay.
14:24:15
And you can see over here what we can say is if approved is equal to and let's
14:24:20
just say the value of true. So go to your boolean and we'll put true. And you
14:24:25
can see it it executes and we have our true branch. So then we can have let's say a social media post created over
14:24:31
here. If it's false, maybe we want to regenerate this image and just like start again here at the beginning. Let
14:24:38
me show you what happens on the false side. So we'll just go over here. We'll click this again. So you can see it's
14:24:43
loading and I will wait for the next email to be sent out.
14:24:52
All right. So we have this over here. And you know what? I'm going to decline it. So I do not want that. It says got
14:24:57
it. Thanks. This page can be closed now. And going in over here, we have this declined. So we can say approved is
14:25:04
false. And then we go over here and we run the step. It goes into the false branch. So now we can have our specific
14:25:11
workflow go back around and regenerate that specific image. And the same thing can happen again. So you can start
14:25:17
seeing that we're going to be building out loops based around the approval or not. And again, we have all these other
14:25:23
nodes over here that we could choose. I just showed you Gmail because it's already set up and we haven't really covered the other sections in over here.
14:25:30
But you can see if I check for Discord for example. There's a connection type. We have a resource send and wait for
14:25:37
response. You set up a server and it's really the same type of things, right? Approve and disapprove. You just change
14:25:43
the environment where this message is sent. I feel it's pretty easy to do with Gmail. In addition, one of the other
14:25:50
really nice things with Nan version two is with sub workflows, it makes it actually really easy to have a human in
14:25:56
the loop aspect. So, you can go into the human in the loop and throw this into another workflow. And I already talked
14:26:03
about this a little bit in the execute subworkflow section. I think I mentioned that we're going to talk about it in
14:26:08
this video, but what I see happening now is people take the human in the loop section and they just literally populate
14:26:15
that directly into another workflow. So let's say like I have this Gmail and I want to send it to another workflow and
14:26:21
I just have this execute subworkflow and we use this human in the loop aspect in multiple workflows. So now we've kind of
14:26:27
templatized it. Obviously there's other steps that you might want to take after this if it's approved or disapproved in
14:26:33
that sub workflow, but it's very common you have this and then let's say we have our social media post like let's say we
14:26:38
have LinkedIn to create a post after and we have that over here. So we'll just say create a post and it kind of
14:26:46
goes like that. Again, you could use these over here or you could use something like an execute subworkflow.
14:26:51
It goes to under the workflow and it performs its action. But that is human in the loop directly here in any end. I
14:26:58
want to also mention there's one other approach to this which really isn't natively here in NE. So I just want to
14:27:06
talk about this really fast. So one of the other ways that you could actually perform human in the loop is kind of
14:27:11
writing to spreadsheets. So, I feel like it's easier to explain this out. So,
14:27:17
let's imagine you have workflow one that generates an image. So, we'll say workflow one
14:27:23
generates an image and then we send that image to Google
14:27:30
Drive and then add a link to a spreadsheet to the image. Well,
14:27:37
then you could have workflow 2 that starts with a trigger.
14:27:44
They trigger when the approved column is set to true. And we've already talked
14:27:50
about the triggers in Google Sheets. But essentially, another way of human in
14:27:55
the loop is building out multiple workflows. So our first workflow generates an image, uploads it to Google Drive, and then adds a link to a
14:28:01
spreadsheet. Someone goes in there, takes a look at the image that was generated, and then if they say yes, it
14:28:07
starts a trigger on a second workflow. Then we have our second workflow, which starts with a trigger based off of the
14:28:13
proof column set to true, and then it will post on social media. Post on social media. So, you can do it
14:28:21
all in one workflow or you could go the route of building out multiple workflows and setting up a spreadsheet. It really
14:28:27
depends also on what your customer wants or what you personally prefer. I've done
14:28:32
both like okay we have the human in loop over here or specify with multiple
14:28:38
workflows like hey we're going to upload this into spreadsheet and then approve it manually on that side of things but
14:28:44
that is human in the loop essentially why companies have this well they just want to have a safeguard something like
14:28:50
a chatbot you're not going to really have a safeguard where people can approve it because chat bots are real time however when you're doing other
14:28:55
types of things like image generation or post generation or whatever the case may be or email response es you want to have
14:29:02
that human in the loop aspect and I would just recommend going in over here rather than looking at the normal
14:29:08
Discord node is it is much faster like if you're using Discord or Gmail like way faster just to go into the human in
14:29:14
the loop rather than search through all the settings because this is already technically set up for us we can make it
14:29:19
so someone approves only I would recommend approve or disprove so that way you can build out a little bit more
14:29:25
complicated workflows if someone declines something maybe you want to refresh that particular image and that's
14:29:30
why I would recommend that and obviously choose a time frame that is reasonable. Don't choose like 45 days to approve an
14:29:36
item. Make sure it's like maybe 45 minutes, an hour. Obviously, it depends on how busy that particular person is
14:29:42
and if they're going to be in meetings or not. So, that is human in the loop and awesome job guys going through the
14:29:48
course so far. I know this was a little bit of an easier section. The next one we're going to be covering is evaluation. Something I really really
14:29:54
like. Another really kind of important and I wouldn't really call this an advanced skill but intermediate skill
14:30:00
that most people should pick up. We're going to talk about evaluations directly in any end as well as evaluations
14:30:05
outside of it. And I will see you in that lesson right now. So this section is going to be covering evaluations. I'm
14:30:12
going to be showing you two different approaches that you could take. One which is going to be external evaluations which does not rely on the
14:30:19
system that NAN built out. And then the second approach is going to show you what NE has created within their
14:30:26
software. I'm also going to give a little bit of a caveat because one of the things I found out about NEN is if
14:30:33
you're on the cheapest cloud plan, you only can have evaluations on one
14:30:39
workflow, which is really a bummer. Um, and it's really not mentioned anywhere
14:30:44
where you can essentially expand out the amount of evaluations. So, I'm going to
14:30:49
just use a workflow that I've already had set up for evaluations. I've already used it in another video. So, I do
14:30:55
apologize for that part being repeated. The first part is not going to be repeated. In fact, I haven't shown this
14:31:01
in another video as of yet on the channel. So, let's jump into both of these really quick. So, what we have
14:31:08
over here is just a a very blank workflow. And I just want to demonstrate what I typically do with evaluations. I
14:31:16
use a framework outside of N. And this framework has helped me quite a bit when
14:31:22
I want to fine-tune essentially what I'm building out. So, what I want to show you really quick is this spreadsheet.
14:31:28
And ideally, what I typically have is let's say I'm running some sort of workflow or automation. I'll first label
14:31:36
our specific inputs over here like okay, what did you input to start the system?
14:31:42
This could be what's being filled out in a form. This could be what's being sent in a chat trigger. This could be like
14:31:50
whatever the case is like sent to a web hook. Whatever is the input that starts
14:31:56
the workflow, this is what goes over here. The next part is the system
14:32:01
prompts. So often when you're building out AI systems or orchestration or
14:32:06
workflows, whatever you want to call it, you're going to have one or more system prompts associated with it. So obviously
14:32:13
if you have multiple systems prompts uh with different agents you're going to want to expand this out. I'm just making
14:32:19
the assumption you only have one AI agent in a workflow uh which is not always the case and I should say one AI
14:32:25
agent or AI node because you can use system prompts with other nodes. So I
14:32:30
would just mention like what system prompt this goes to as well as the model
14:32:35
used. So define your input you know what starts your system define your system
14:32:42
prompt for each AI node as well as the model specifically used. The result
14:32:47
could be two parts. So like one is the result of the entire system or what is
14:32:52
the result for that specific AI node or AI agent or whatever the case is. Again you could expand this out afterwards.
14:33:00
Then what I have as well is a notes section. So when you run the workflow or
14:33:06
someone else at your company runs the workflow, they can put an additional notes. And how I like building these
14:33:11
out, I actually like color coding these. So what I try to teach people is like if this worked perfect, label this as
14:33:18
green. If it had a hallucination of some sort or just did not work, label it red.
14:33:24
If it almost got it correct and there's just like something minor, whether it's like a formatting or whatever the case
14:33:29
may be, highlight this yellow. What I end up doing is I will always take a
14:33:34
look at this and say, "Okay, what do I notice? Do I notice any trends? What can I fix to turn those yellows into greens,
14:33:41
those reds into yellow or green?" Um, on the corporate side, there's two other things I would probably recommend for
14:33:48
you to do. On the first is you want to typically have some sort of backlog where you're showing or not necessarily
14:33:54
a backlog, but some sort of log that shows incremental improvements over time. So what I would define also is a
14:34:01
date as well as user and then also like reviewer and review date. So the reason
14:34:08
why is depending on like what type of systems you're in like
14:34:15
this is just on my side because I work in risk and underwriting. We have external parties that need to audit what
14:34:22
we specifically do. So it's really important that we define what is being
14:34:27
sent to AI agents, what is happening in our systems. So you want to have a
14:34:32
framework like this like uh who used it, what was the review associated with it
14:34:38
like and then you can just see improvements over time. And this is helpful as well when there's like some
14:34:43
sort of governance with AI because since models are changing all the time, if you want to upgrade models, you want to make
14:34:49
sure it's working properly. And if it doesn't work properly, maybe you fall back to a little bit of an older model.
14:34:55
Either way, that is kind of the framework I like to do. And you can honestly just add this into our workflow
14:35:02
where you just append or update row in a sheet. I would just append a row in and you would append in, you know, that
14:35:09
specific results, the dates of that results and some other info if you want to grab it specifically or not. or you
14:35:16
can just sp code in like a system prompt if you're not really changing it that often. And then what I like to do as
14:35:21
well is if like there's a massive change. I'll typically just like black out a line and then just start with the
14:35:27
line below. Um obviously you can just fill out text over here or just put like all X's or dots or whatever the case may
14:35:34
be. So when you append a new row, it doesn't fill in that specific row. But there's a lot of different options on
14:35:40
that side of things. So you're going to take anything away from this like define what prompt you're using. Define what
14:35:45
models you're using. Put in the results. Make sure that you put in some notes like what worked correctly, what didn't
14:35:51
work, color code, green, yellow, red, and put in the dates when things are changing or not. This will really help
14:35:58
you out with specifically logging changes and things like that. So, that
14:36:04
is this section. This isn't really fun, but I want to show you also what NEN has
14:36:09
built out. Now again, since I'm limited on evaluations, like if you take a look,
14:36:14
if I go over here, I'm just going to save this. We go into evaluations. You could say
14:36:19
it's says limit reach to your plan includes custom metrics for one workflow only, which is so annoying, man. Um,
14:36:27
wonder if I could happen skip. I can't. Like you can see it says run editor and I just don't have that option. So,
14:36:34
instead of deleting my workflow, I'm literally just going to show you what happens. Like, I've tried to figure out
14:36:42
how to reset these evaluations. Like, I generally don't know. Um, how I can
14:36:48
reset it. Like, I don't want to delete this workflow. And I mean, maybe I have to turn off the
14:36:55
evaluations. I don't know. I I have to talk to any end team still about this because I just don't think it's crystal
14:37:01
clear. like maybe you can clear evaluations and it works in other workflows is I I like what they built
14:37:07
out and maybe other people are having this problem as well. I just want to quickly go over the specific nodes that
14:37:14
we're using over here. So when you use evaluations in any you can actually have
14:37:19
an evaluation data set. So you can define that data set in either Google Sheets or a data table in N in Google
14:37:28
Sheets or in Nan and this is what you can use to test
14:37:33
your workflow. You know I see both sides of it or like you could test with a test
14:37:38
data set over here or use start using live data and test it directly in here. I've seen both used so they're both both
14:37:45
okay. Um so over here this would be like the test data. Then what you have over
14:37:50
here next is check if evaluating. So what this note essentially does is like if you grab your data from this
14:37:57
evaluation, it will split your workflow and go into the evaluation side. Whereas if it's not and it's a normal test of
14:38:04
your workflow, a normal run of your workflow, it'll go to the opposite side. So you can think of this as like an if
14:38:10
else like okay, if our if we use evaluation data, we go one way. If not,
14:38:16
we just run this as normal. Um, so that is essentially what this check if evaluating does. Set outputs presents
14:38:24
the results that are ran into a Google Sheets or data table. So very similar like what I have over here just
14:38:30
populating in data. Uh going back on this side of things, what we have next
14:38:36
what we have next is uh different metrics. So there's metrics that involve
14:38:42
an AI agent or not AI agent but a AI model and there's metrics that don't evolve around an AI model. So you can
14:38:49
see uses AI is correctness whether the answer is meaning is consistent with the supplied reference answer. So in this
14:38:55
case when we're doing evaluations we have essentially what we expected for
14:39:00
that correct answer and um what we're testing right whereas over here when we
14:39:07
go into this one over here we don't define automatically what the correct answer is it's up to interpretation of
14:39:14
the person that is running. So this is a little bit different than what N evaluations has. and evaluations expects
14:39:21
you to already kind of know what the answer is. Whereas this over here, it it's sub it's subjective. Someone could
14:39:27
say this is correct or not. Um it's up to them. Whereas this one, it's pretty definitive. Obviously uses AI uses AI
14:39:34
model to take a look at what the supplied answer should be versus what answer you get from your AI agent. Um so
14:39:41
there's two different ways to use this. Use correctness, so whether the answer's meaning is consistent or not, and
14:39:46
helpfulness, whether the answer is helpful or not. And any defines this as a one through five. There's specific
14:39:52
prompts. NonAI, you have uh three different options tools used. So this is
14:39:58
important to me measure like are the tools correctly being used by your AI agent. Um then you have categorization
14:40:04
whether the answer is an exact match or not. You can think of this as like a categorization with machine learning as
14:40:10
well like where you're trying to predict a category. This is it with specifically AI agents. Then you have string
14:40:16
similarity. how close is the answer to the reference answer? Um, it returns a score 0 to one that's going to be
14:40:22
decimal of some capacity. So really the difference between both of these approaches and is a lot more structured
14:40:29
like you have your your evaluation set and then you split your workflow, you have your outputs getting sent to a
14:40:36
spreadsheet and then you already have like what you expected to be correct or not. And if it's something that deals
14:40:42
with just text in general, like um that's not a specific category text that
14:40:48
changes, there's two ways. It's either correct or not with helpfulness if it's going to be something that you expect
14:40:54
almost like a correct answer every time. It's categorization string similarity if you have an output and then tools used.
14:41:01
And yeah, like these were some of the different examples I was going to use for this even evaluations video, but I
14:41:07
got blocked because you only can have one evaluation at a time. But regardless, evaluations are important.
14:41:13
So, if you want to delete your workflows or delete these evaluations after you use it, um, go for it. Or if you have an
14:41:20
upper tier plan and you can constantly use evaluations, highly recommend that you mess with it. Otherwise, kind of go
14:41:26
with this Google Sheets route. A lot of people um that build AI systems will do this. They'll just kind of have
14:41:32
something like this. Obviously, it changed for a different scenario. Green, yellow, red, and just improve it over
14:41:38
time. This is what I've used in systems that I build for work. And it's done a
14:41:43
pretty good job. Obviously, there's things I I would improve over time and things that I can add in um as design is
14:41:50
getting changed a little bit. Also, I apologize. I'm losing my voice. So, we've been recording non-stop. I don't even know how far into the course this
14:41:57
is. I've been recording it over like three or four days, but so I feel a little tired and my voice is being lost
14:42:04
a little bit. I'm trying to get this out by January 1st. I don't know if it's going to happen or not, but I apologize
14:42:10
if I didn't go out of step as I wanted to for evaluations, but it is a really
14:42:16
really important concept to test your workflows, see if they are getting correct or not. Um, and yeah, and you
14:42:23
might be wondering like what is the correct amount of data to test a workflow? It really depends on how
14:42:28
critical a system is and how long you want to test it. Um, I constantly test
14:42:33
things at work. Like even if things are like fully correct, I'm still doing a
14:42:39
test every week or every other week just to make sure it still is working properly. And uh, yeah, that is
14:42:46
essentially it for evaluations. The next section we're going to be covering is a
14:42:51
little bit bit about security and compliance. So, a little bit more important stuff. We're going to talk about guard rails. We're going to talk
14:42:58
about just logging in general, which is very similar um to logging. This is kind of just evaluations on that. And talked
14:43:06
about web hook security, but we'll cover that again. And then we'll also cover
14:43:12
credential management, version control, and uh naming conventions. So, I will see you guys in that next video. I don't
14:43:19
know why I'm on this workflows page. We'll go back to this evaluations page and end it there. All right, see you
14:43:24
guys. So far through this course, you've been building a lot of workflows from scratch and if an API doesn't exist,
14:43:31
you've had to use the HTTP request node, but I'm going to be showing you guys some shortcuts that might save you some
14:43:38
time. This won't be applicable in every single case, so don't use it as a
14:43:43
crutch. However, if there is a specific use case that you need done and you think, "Hey, I might be able to save
14:43:48
some time after this video," definitely take that approach. Uh, so let's jump into it right now and I'm going to show
14:43:54
you kind of four different ways. All right, so the first way we're going to do is go over here and we're going to
14:44:00
actually look at templates. So, there are a ton of templates online. In fact,
14:44:06
I showed you quite early on in the course how to import in templates just because of all the material. Uh, but all
14:44:12
I'm going to go over here is say N template library. And you'll go to the
14:44:17
website. It says 7,656 workflow automations.
14:44:23
And depending on what you specifically want to search, it's they might have
14:44:28
something already over here that you could start with. Now, the thing with templates, a lot of people will build
14:44:34
out some fancy automation and you don't need all of that or there's going to be small sections that are broken.
14:44:39
Obviously, the NE team does a fantastic job vetting these templates, but NE is a fastmoving software. There's new updates
14:44:46
constantly, and you know, something that uses a Python code node 6 months ago is
14:44:51
going to be broken. Something that specifically uses uh maybe a human in the loop with that execute uh sub
14:44:59
workflow could possibly be broken just because things do change uh from version to version and you'll have to update
14:45:06
that. So, a little bit of heads up on that side of things because some of these are a little bit older. But let's take a look at this over here. Generate
14:45:12
AI viral videos on ano banana in V3. So, I've already showed you essentially how to do that. It says shared on socials
14:45:19
via Bolato. And we can take a look at this over
14:45:24
here. And first, on this side of things, you can mostly zoom in, I want to say, on
14:45:30
these templates. I don't know why it's not letting me zoom in on this one, which is kind of weird. Maybe I'll just refresh. Normally you can just like zoom
14:45:36
in and things like that but it is not like you can just drag around but either
14:45:42
way you can see step one like this guy did a pretty good job put a full tutorial documentation requirements on
14:45:47
the side so major props there you can see step one collect the ideas and image create two create image with nano banana
14:45:54
so we have a very similar workflow mine's a little bit different step three it says generate video ad script and
14:46:00
then step four generate video with V3 and step five post to all platform platforms. So, I haven't tested Blow
14:46:06
Blowato yet. I heard some pretty good things about it. I believe the the founder of that was recently on the N
14:46:12
podcast, but yeah, I don't know why this isn't letting me zoom in. Maybe it's like a bug on the platform right now, but and
14:46:19
you can see last update is four months ago associated with this. It tells you who this is for, what problem solve,
14:46:26
what this workflow does, the setup associated with it. Like this is really, really good documentation on the side of
14:46:33
things. So, let's actually try to download this. I'm going to click use for free. And I'm going to import in
14:46:39
over here. Uh, you could copy the template to support JSON. You could open self-hosting. I'm just going to import
14:46:45
the template to my cloud workspace. And you'll see set this up. And it says
14:46:53
you need one Telegram, one Google Sheets, one Google Drive to set up this template. And I'm just going to click skip. Now, obviously, I would recommend
14:47:00
that you set up these credentials because I don't have a Telegram yet. I haven't built this out for YouTube yet,
14:47:05
but it is in my backlog. Uh, Google Sheets, Google Drive, OpenAI. I'm just going to click skip. We're going to load
14:47:11
this template up. And boom, we have this in over here. Obviously, I have issues with Telegram because I haven't set that
14:47:17
up. And that's why you see these red icons over here. It says credential. But, we have just successfully gone to
14:47:24
the NE website. We wanted to download this and it says use for free. And we have this over here. So, I'm actually
14:47:30
curious what this guy um I'm not familiar with this YouTuber.
14:47:36
You can see this has 9,000 views, the AI doctor. So, someone else to watch possibly. Don't uh completely leave my
14:47:43
channel for this guy. But, uh regardless, it was a pretty cool workflow on that side of things. And uh this is not beginner friendly. It's for
14:47:49
people who already know any. And the well taken point introduction to 11 lab and information about 10,00 credit. nice
14:47:55
work as an update. So, this is not the right link connected to my automation. Mine was about Nano Banana.
14:48:01
Oh, I guess put the wrong link in his thing over here. Either way, um, and you can see
14:48:08
actually a lot of people watch this video from over there. So, uh, full documentation on notion. Let's take a
14:48:14
look at that. Again, this is a great template in my personal opinion because you have a lot of ideas over here. Uh he
14:48:21
has his notion link, download my workflow, has all this over here
14:48:27
like a ton of stuff all built out on this side of things like really really
14:48:32
crazy value on there. I create a bolato account pro plan required for API access. You can see it links over here.
14:48:39
You can see there's a referral. So obviously some sort of affiliate associated with it. Yeah, this was the
14:48:45
nan uh I want to say
14:48:51
podcast I was listening to. I'm actually curious about the pricing. So, you can see starter $29, creator 97,
14:48:58
agency $4.99 at 1250 credits per month. There's a lot of different things in
14:49:03
here. So, either way, I'm going to close out over here. Just showing you an example.
14:49:10
And uh yeah, just set up your credentials, test out the workflow, see if it works for you. I'd also personally
14:49:16
take a look at like what's happening. So maybe you don't want to start with Telegram, you want to do something else. Like you can always delete these. You
14:49:22
don't necessarily have to follow the workflow. Just remember like there's other nodes that are going to be incorporated. So like you can see over
14:49:28
here, this Telegram trigger, this inputs that and also this. So based off of
14:49:34
this, like you're going to have to change two different nodes. So just follow the patterns. Um, and also a
14:49:40
little bit of pet peeve. I don't like when when they're vertical like this. I always just like putting it horizontal
14:49:46
and then if like two things need to happen, go like that. But that's a minor pet peeve because obviously there's a
14:49:51
lot of effort that was put into this template and things like that. It probably works fantastic. Regardless,
14:49:57
just go through it over here and see what's happening. You can see this over here. Posts on multiple platforms. Tik Tok, LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube,
14:50:04
Twitter, Threads, Blue Sky, as well as Pinterest. There's this merge node which we've covered merge nodes. There's nine
14:50:10
different merges over there. I'm curious. Um, wait for all inputs to arrive. Data specific input use input
14:50:16
over there. Update status to done. So, pretty awesome on that side of things.
14:50:21
So, a lot of documentation. So, that is one way that you could populate those. I'm going to go back to templates. Let's
14:50:28
uh leave out of here and then just search for something. Now, I don't know what I'm going to search for right now,
14:50:34
but let's see. Um, I'm just literally going to look for featured templates or something like that. Automate 3D models. Oh, I saw this on LinkedIn this morning.
14:50:41
So, let's take a look at this. Automate 3D model generation from images using CM 3D and sheets. Yeah, I saw this on here.
14:50:48
So, let's So, you can see this one allows click to explore.
14:50:53
So, this is pretty sick. All right. So, what happens? Step one, Google Sheets.
14:50:58
So, you can actually mess around with this before we actually even jump into our instance. So in the image model, use
14:51:04
the basic image to dress. Leave 3D results. Get the foul API key. This was
14:51:10
created with foul. Interesting. And you can see we have a golfer
14:51:15
swinging. And then we have our golfer over here. Although I would have
14:51:21
probably just changed that up so they're one to one. That is really cool though.
14:51:30
And free template and tutorial. Oh, is that his YouTube channel, too? My new YouTube channel. Let's take a
14:51:37
look. Oh, I guess they're just shorts. I'll give
14:51:45
him a subscribe. I don't know if he's watching this video, but five subscribers, five videos. There you go.
14:51:50
I'm subscriber number six. Either way, um, this is pretty cool. And you can see use cases. sports analytics, emotion
14:51:57
optimization, fitness, health, fashion, gaming. I have some fitness customers.
14:52:03
So, this is pretty sick. I I like this a lot. This is cool.
14:52:11
And it says, "Need help customizing? Contact me for consulting." Oh, I didn't even know you could put that in here on
14:52:17
the any community forums. So, you can put your email in here and
14:52:23
you can add someone on LinkedIn. That's pretty sweet. Uh you can see setup steps. There's a lot of steps associated
14:52:29
with it really going into the documentation. So you know not everything in on the work on the
14:52:35
templates is going to have this thorough of documentation. This one does however and uh it is pretty great side of
14:52:42
things. So you can click use for free this time. Let's just copy uh template
14:52:47
to clipboard. So we have that over here. I'm going to go into any end now. And uh
14:52:53
we can go over here and click these three dots. And what we could do is import from a URL or a file, whatever
14:53:00
the case may be. Let's do a file. I'm going to create a new JSON file really fast. And uh we'll go in there. All
14:53:07
right. So, I'm just in VS Code. I'm just going to save this. Obviously, there's other ways you could save your JSON, but
14:53:12
I'm just showing you this over here. I'm going to save this really quick. And I'm just going to save this under downloads.
14:53:20
or desktop. We'll just put this on desktop. We'll say 3D image.
14:53:26
Save. And I probably should put underscore, but that's all right. And then what I'm going to do is click these three dots. I'm going to import in from
14:53:32
a file. Go over here to desktop 3D image. And since we just imported this
14:53:39
in, you can see all this over here. And again, like if you if you download a
14:53:44
template and there's a creator that does this, give them a subscribe. Like you have to understand this is a lot of
14:53:49
effort to building in these templates, put in the documentation, write it up for forums. Um, so obviously like people
14:53:56
are trying to build out their social following and there's nothing wrong with that. So support those creators out there. I know the first one I showed you
14:54:01
a YouTube uh creator. This one also was built by another YouTube creator. They're building out some pretty cool
14:54:07
use cases. I I like this one a ton. Either way, that is the forms. You can
14:54:13
obviously search stuff as well. So just going back to templates. Let's say I wanted to have something with Discord.
14:54:19
So I can search Discord and it shows me 113 different templates that people have
14:54:25
created for Discord. So let's say I want to do something with HubSpot. And also, by the way, you can see um verified
14:54:31
creators and things like that and see what other templates they have. So like imagine you like this guy's template. Well, you can see his other templates
14:54:38
associated with it. Rahul Joshy, let's say you like his templates. You can see how many of these over here. and he
14:54:45
doesn't really have a lot of views unfortunately. Um, let's say David, he has 204. Wow. And he has his school
14:54:52
community, a hacker by nature. So, you can take a look at what's going on over there. He has his own uh school
14:54:59
community too. 100 members at $47 a month powered by school. Regardless, he
14:55:04
has all these templates on here and you can take a look at that. So, let's say you want to send messages from a agents with the mandrel. Cool tool to MCP
14:55:10
server says user free. We have a full setup over here as well. And uh yeah, this is pretty awesome. So that is the
14:55:17
forums. That's only one way though to essentially build out your workloads. I'm just going to close out my VS Code
14:55:23
that I have off to the side because I can't see my notes. And we're going to jump into our next example. And uh our
14:55:30
next thing that's going to save us some time is the AI workflow builder. So I'm just going to create a new workflow.
14:55:35
Well, I already have this over here. Um where is our section 24? I'm just going to go home. Leave without saving. We
14:55:42
don't need to have that right now. We're going to go back into section 24. All right. So, you'll notice on here we have
14:55:49
add first steps or start from a template. Obviously, you can go templates over here as well, which I didn't even show you, but you can just
14:55:54
literally say automated quiz delivery with Google Sheets and Telegram. Let's just use that or scrape AI news. Let's
14:56:01
scrape this. Use this workflow. Again, you'll see the same screens. So, I'm not
14:56:06
going to waste your time setting that up, but I just want to show you that you can do it's a template here. You don't necessarily have to go to the template library, but let's go into build with
14:56:13
AI. So, you'll see you have a monthly credit on this side of things. And there's other ones that are built in.
14:56:19
And later in the course, we're going to be talking about rag. So, maybe I want to build out something automated with a
14:56:25
rag knowledge assistant. So, I'm going to click this. Obviously, you could type out exactly what you want, but let's say
14:56:31
I want to do the rag knowledge assistant. So, it says build an automation that creates an a document to chat rag pipeline. The workflow starts
14:56:38
with an any form where a user uploads one or more files. Each upload should trigger a process that reads the file,
14:56:43
splits into chunks, and generates embeddings using OpenAI. You can see uses 41 mini, which is an older model. I
14:56:49
probably wouldn't recommend using that old of a model. Um, saved in one pine cone table. Add a second part of the
14:56:54
workflow for querying. Use a chat message. So, like this is a lot of information. This is very thorough and you should be as thorough as possible as
14:57:00
well on the side of things. It's like prompting. uh the better that your prompts are, the more likely you're going to get a better accurate
14:57:07
representation. So, let's run this. I'm curious if it's only one credit. So, it says remaining AI credits 50, monthly
14:57:12
credits 50, one credit equals one message. So, credits renewed February 1st, 2026, unused credits expire. So,
14:57:19
one credit to use this. You might as well try it and see how well this goes. And I'm going to run this and you'll see
14:57:25
it says thinking and we have all this getting built out right now over here. And it's working. So we'll see how this
14:57:32
populates. And it says, I'll build a comprehensive document to chat rag pipeline with form
14:57:37
uploaded, embedded generation, and chatbot interface. So I'm actually curious how long this particularly
14:57:44
takes. And uh we'll see. So we're about 2 minutes into this right now, and you
14:57:49
can see it already populated these nodes. However, it still hasn't built the workflow. So again, I'll just pause
14:57:54
and wait for this to be ready so that way you don't waste your guys time. All right, another minute in. Essentially,
14:58:00
we have this over here, but it still says it's working. I don't think it's ready to go yet, obviously. Taking a
14:58:05
look at this. And uh we will see what happens. Another minute in and you can
14:58:11
see it's changed things up, but it is still thinking. You can see thinking on
14:58:16
the side, working over here. And just more updates.
14:58:23
All right. So, this took me I want to say four to five minutes. And uh cool.
14:58:29
Let's take a look at what is going on. So first we have a response how to set up. It says pine cone configuration. It
14:58:35
tells you data tables create two data tables in any end. One for storing form uploads one for logging chat email
14:58:42
address in the send daily summary email node replace there. Pine cone credentials credentials Gmail
14:58:48
credentials. So I think it's pretty nice that it tells you like hey set these credentials up. Workflow has three main parts. document upload chat interface
14:58:56
daily reporting every day at 9 a.m. The workflow analyzes chat logs and emails a summary of stats top reference files and
14:59:02
field lookups. And then it says complete these steps before executing your workflow. Update pine cone index with
14:59:08
the parameter store form uploads. So you have to upload these over here. Log chat
14:59:13
interactions fetch chat logs and then send daily over here. Update as that side of things. So you can go over here
14:59:20
and build these particularly out. I'm actually curious as well just taking a look at how this is being built out. So
14:59:28
what we have over here is our form upload and also can I not move these? Okay, I can't move
14:59:34
this. I was just spot. All right, so first off from the design perspective, I
14:59:41
do like how we split this out, but it is kind of weird. So like you can see
14:59:49
I don't know if I would have set this up like this.
14:59:58
Like just from the design, it's a little bit funky.
15:00:04
I guess that's okay. All right. So, I think this looks already a little bit better. Again, I I don't know. I just
15:00:09
like having the lines go like this. Making a little bit better. Um, even
15:00:15
things like this, like you can see the chat trigger.
15:00:23
And uh, I don't know. I'm one that always likes just duplicating this just
15:00:28
I think it's cleaner. I know it's I know they're both connected to the same thing. I just like that's just a
15:00:36
personal use. Like I think this just looks cleaner. Some people are going to disagree, but I think already this looks
15:00:42
way better just moving things around. So, it's just like a a pet peeve. I don't even know if this works correctly
15:00:47
or not. And obviously, you can test it out. I'm curious. We have different settings already filled out in here, too, which is kind of nice. It'll save
15:00:54
you some time. Book configuration placeholder value. So, make sure to fill that in as you need it. You can see over
15:01:02
here pine cone index from a little bit earlier with the exact JSON that we need
15:01:08
and the schedule summary. Also, this chat trigger is huge. I've never seen it
15:01:14
that big. Never seen it that big. Is it just because it's publicly available? I wonder if I turn that off.
15:01:22
That is ah okay publicly available.
15:01:27
No, it went back. That's weird that it uh
15:01:33
turned huge. I may control Z that. Oops.
15:01:38
I guess I can't control Z what's going on in that chat trigger. Interesting. Either way, you can see
15:01:45
like it it builds out your framework. Our goal of this video wasn't to really evaluate this whatever was built in, but
15:01:53
yeah. So, that is another option. You can go over here to the workflow builder and start out. Now, this isn't going to
15:01:58
be 100% correct. As I mentioned, even with templates, you're going to have to customize it to your own liking. Some
15:02:05
nodes might have incorrect settings. So, you're going to have to go in here and test it out. But, it does a lot of the
15:02:11
framework and already a lot of the building. So, there probably is ways that you could architecture things better and uh make it a little bit more
15:02:17
efficient. But, out of the box, it's probably not too bad over there. Just remember, you have 50 by default. So,
15:02:24
we're going to just say this is like part two,
15:02:29
part one. It doesn't really matter. I don't know. I'm I'm obviously going to be uploading these files to our school
15:02:34
group on the side things. So, this is saved. The next thing I want to talk about is just asking a large language
15:02:40
model and I'll just create a new workflow for that. So, we're going to create new workflow. I'll create it in
15:02:46
personal and uh yeah, we'll just call this building workflows faster part two.
15:02:51
And what I would recommend is use alert tech is pretty good at code building. I
15:02:57
like using claude and I actually have a paid claude account at $20 a month just because I find if you don't you run out
15:03:04
of messages pretty fast. So I find this is a pretty good investment if it just saves me an extra hour to three hours a
15:03:11
week. So what we're going to do on here is ask it to build a nan workflow. And
15:03:17
what's really cool is you can actually get JSON back based around it. So, I'm going to say, can you build me can you
15:03:24
build me a NE workflow based on N v2
15:03:31
docs that takes a YouTube video
15:03:38
and uh populates a uh let's say LinkedIn message
15:03:46
message. Obviously, this isn't really a thorough prompt, but imagine just taking YouTube video and then we want to
15:03:52
LinkedIn message on social media. So, maybe I'll instead of populates a LinkedIn post about it on social media
15:04:00
and I wouldn't recommend you do this as well, please. There's a lot of nuances in like what makes a good post and things like that, things that I'm still
15:04:06
learning about, but I'm just going to say over here, please
15:04:11
provide me the JSON. All right. So, we'll see what happens on
15:04:18
the side of things, but you will see what happens. All right. So, we have all of our JSON that is
15:04:25
getting populated right now. We have all this information, manual trigger, YouTube details, LinkedIn format over
15:04:32
here, setup requirements. So, it gives you setup requirements as well. Very similar to what happened with um our
15:04:38
templates and what happened directly when we were asking the workflow to be built out. It says import this JSON and
15:04:43
nan add your credentials test with the manual trigger by pasting YouTube URL like this. So this is one approach on
15:04:51
how you could do that. And just to go back over here we'll save this into VS Code first. So I'm just going to say
15:04:58
this is still 3D image. It doesn't really matter. This is just whatever else it is. So we'll go over here and
15:05:04
then we'll import from file. We'll grab 3D image. And yeah, this didn't work
15:05:10
correctly. So, we're going to have to reprompt it and uh we'll test that out. All right. So, obviously this did not
15:05:17
work. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a screenshot of this and I'm going to reprompt it back over here.
15:05:22
So, I'm going to say I imported in this JSON
15:05:28
in this JSON. However, it didn't work.
15:05:35
Are you using the ND2 docs with a question mark? And I'll put
15:05:43
this over here and uh paste that in.
15:05:56
Okay. So, you're right. I need to check the actual NV2 docs and then it's going to search the web
15:06:02
and it's going to start going through this as well. So a lot of people if they see a mistake they'll just give up at
15:06:10
first and you know oh well this doesn't work it but you need to reprompt things
15:06:16
if you see errors. So I'm actually curious as well when jumping into this workflow. We have a manual trigger this
15:06:23
generate. We actually have a prompt that's in over here. And then um we have
15:06:29
the format post data no path pack to node. Yikes. Whatever this is over here
15:06:37
that's weird. Install this node to use it. This node is currently not installed. It either is from newer version and a custom node or is it
15:06:43
invalid structure. It's probably just invalid structure. I'm going to control-z all this because I don't want this in here over here. And uh yeah,
15:06:50
we'll see what the new JSON is. Looking at your screenshot. I see the issue. The link to node andv2 has a simpler
15:06:56
structure when initially provided may create a workflow based around it. So now it's building this out and uh yeah
15:07:02
we have this over here. So let's see if this works or not. We're going to go over here and paste that in and we can
15:07:11
go back. So we'll say import from file. We'll import in this 3D image again.
15:07:18
Obviously it did not work. So this use case does not work and it's unfortunate.
15:07:23
So, I'm going to go over here and say this does not work. This didn't work.
15:07:32
Can you please give me an outline
15:07:38
of what nodes to use and when? So, this is another
15:07:43
thing that you could utilize LLMs for. Obviously, like I don't like relying on
15:07:49
a large language model or the a workflow builder to build out my workflows from scratch. However, I think using LM to
15:07:56
give you ideas on like what nodes to use and when is okay. So, I'm just going to say this didn't work. Can you please
15:08:02
give me an outline of what nodes to use and where at?
15:08:09
And what it'll do is think about this and it'll give me some ideas. So, let's
15:08:14
see what the ideas are like on the side of it. It says, "Absolutely. Let me give you a clear step-by-step outline.
15:08:21
Workflow outline YouTube LinkedIn. Number one is a manual trigger. Start the workflow. Add a field." So, I don't
15:08:26
love the manual trigger. I think there's probably easier ways, but that's fine. Then we have a code node. Extract video
15:08:32
ID from YouTube URL and it takes the video ID. Yep, I've I've done that before, so that's good. HTTP request get
15:08:39
YouTube video details from YouTube data API. Okay, that's good there. Again, I don't know if this is actually working
15:08:45
or not and maybe we want to test this out. Uh code node format the date or data from OpenAI extracts title,
15:08:51
description, views, likes from YouTube response. So we have that over there.
15:08:56
This obviously has an issue over here. So it says five open AAI
15:09:02
and then it says create a LinkedIn post make it engaging. So just an issue with Claude. Step six is LinkedIn. So I don't
15:09:09
think LinkedIn has a note. I'm not too sure. Let's go over here and say LinkedIn. It does have a node. I just
15:09:15
haven't used it. And there's a create a post which is cool. And it says manual over here. Start line makes sense. Which
15:09:21
nodes are you getting stuck on? So obviously as you're building this out, you can keep sending questions back and forth. I think I showed you guys this in
15:09:28
the debugging section where you have an issue, you can paste it over here and it can help you solve it. Um, but yeah, I
15:09:34
kind of like using the outlines just to get into a new chat as well. You can also add in connectors and stuff like that.
15:09:40
We can say add connectors and I believe N also is in over here. So uh we have N
15:09:46
access and run your workflows and we'll cover that here in a second for MCP. I want to say there was like a I thought
15:09:52
there was documentation in over here. I could be wrong though. Um either way that is one option over here just to
15:10:00
kind of show you like yeah you can use large language models. They're probably not going to be the most accurate to build out a workflow as solve those
15:10:07
errors. I would just recommend them to say, "Hey, what nodes do you specifically want to use?" And I think
15:10:13
it's helpful over there. The last thing I want to do is finding and vetting community nodes because as I showed you,
15:10:20
like not everything is on here and really for the community node section, this is going to be more for self-hosted
15:10:25
rather than cloud. Obviously, cloud is getting more community nodes in. Um, but this part of the tutorial is kind of
15:10:30
just focused on uh self-hosted. So the benefit of self-hosted is you have options for the community nodes. So I'm
15:10:38
just going to search over here n community node list
15:10:43
and I believe there's different things over here. So like 100 community nodes sorted. I don't know if this is up to
15:10:49
date or not and I don't know how many of these are directly in cloud versus else.
15:10:55
So these are crawled when was this last crawled? 2025. So you can see total nodes found like over essentially a year
15:11:02
5xed new nodes total this is pretty cool 18 nodes per day and you can see there's
15:11:08
different things around over here provides a hub focused on WhatsApp provides a channel hub WhatsApp so you
15:11:15
have all these different nodes over here GitHub awesome nan and you can just go
15:11:20
through each of these see when they're last updated what the description is and there might be things over here that
15:11:26
just save you a lot of time. And obviously, just keep checking these out.
15:11:31
Data processing, validation, utilities because some of these you're not going to have to specifically build a HTTP
15:11:38
request. Again, this focuses on the self-hosted side of things. I would highly recommend you take a look at the community notes, see if what you need is
15:11:45
in over here, and uh save yourself some time. All right, so just to kind of
15:11:51
recap what we covered today, I showed you essentially templates where you go to the template library. uh you can grab
15:11:58
the JSON or add it directly into your workflow. We also talked about the specific builder. There is ways that you
15:12:04
could use your large language model to get more accurate builds. Obviously, this one I showed you today completely
15:12:11
failed, but that's okay. Um you can go in over here as well. I I closed it and just ask for, hey, what nodes should I
15:12:18
use for this workflow? I think that works a little bit better. I've used that in the past for just some idea
15:12:23
planning and I think LLMs are really good also at helping you debug as well
15:12:28
as like taking a look at some settings that you might want to utilize. But building out a work workflow from
15:12:34
scratch probably use the workflow builder here in N. Again, not to discredit the LMS. I think there is
15:12:39
other ways and I've seen some other YouTube videos. I haven't watched them full in depth, but uh that's kind of my approach on there. So that's awesome.
15:12:47
The next section we're going to be covering security and compliance. So, this one's a little bit more of a fun one. The next one's going to be a little
15:12:54
bit more technical and we'll catch you in that video. So, I know security and
15:13:00
compliance can be a boring side of either coding or AI automations, but in
15:13:06
the real world, this is something that a lot of companies will require you to do, especially if you're going to be dealing
15:13:13
with some sort of sensitive information. So, in this section, we're going to be covering that. Um, some of the stuff
15:13:19
we're going to be talking about has been repeated a little bit earlier on in the course. There's also going to be some
15:13:24
new material as well. So, with that out of the way, let's take a look at the section. All right. So, the first part
15:13:32
of this, we're going to do a uh brand new node, which we haven't really covered yet, minus a small mention of
15:13:39
it, and this is guardrails. So guardrails are amazing because we have
15:13:45
different options. We can check text for any sort of violation and then we can
15:13:50
also sanitize the text. So I'm going to grab both of these nodes and we're going
15:13:55
to explain what the differences are. So we're going to go back to guardrails
15:14:00
and sanitize text. Okay. So let me explain what goes on for these. So the
15:14:06
first part of it, it says check text for violations. And you'll see that there is two paths. So essentially, if your text
15:14:14
has something that you do not want to be sent into an AI agent, you would want to
15:14:20
use something like this. If it passes, it goes straight into your AI agent. So you could say you have an AI agent over
15:14:26
here. And uh ideally, we pass that in. However, if it fails, right, and some
15:14:34
will fail, you might want to do something like Slack and then send a message to a specific person in it. Uh,
15:14:42
so we can go over here and send a message or you can send an email and you
15:14:47
can log it as well. So, you would want to put like Google Sheets and log this or um you can use a data table here in
15:14:54
ending N. And I'll go over here and append row and sheet. So ideally,
15:15:01
if there's no issues with your text, it goes straight in your agent. Otherwise,
15:15:06
you alert someone again. It could be Gmail, it could be Slack, it could be Discord, whatever it is, and you log
15:15:13
that information. And what are those violations? Well, let's take a look at the node. So, what you have over here is
15:15:19
check text for violations. You put in some text and then you add in a guard room. So, first is keywords. So if
15:15:27
there's a specific keyword that you do not want mentioned in your text, that could be a guardrail.
15:15:34
Have jailbreak. So essentially what a jailbreak is are people trying to go
15:15:40
around violations and you can customize prompts over here. So this is like jailbreaking a prompt and you hear about
15:15:47
jailbreaking prompts on the news occasionally. So jailbreak is any attempt to deliberately attempt to circumvent, deceive or manipulate the AI
15:15:54
safety, ethical or policy constraints. So that is jailbreaking. And you can
15:15:59
change the threshold. You can increase this higher or you can decrease this. And it says input scoring less than this
15:16:04
will be treated as violations. So that is jailbreak. Let me close those out. Next you have NSFW. Uh and you can
15:16:12
obviously change that threshold as well. No need to talk about that. Not safe for work. Then you have something that's
15:16:19
PII. So this is personal data for people and you can choose selected entities. So
15:16:26
you can see if there's like a credit card, crypto, uh, email address, IBIN code, IP address, location and like
15:16:33
working from the fintech space, PII like you we we get in trouble if we send PII
15:16:39
information into a large language model. In fact, it's part of our AI policy. So we have to be very careful on what data
15:16:46
that you send in. And something like this would be great to use at least at my personal workspace. All right. So
15:16:53
after PII you have secret keys. So this is like if you send an API key like you don't want to leak your keys. So another
15:17:00
thing that and in the corporate world super important not to leak your keys because you'll have your CTO or your IT
15:17:07
department really mad at you. Uh topical alignment. So, this essentially lets you know like, hey, we're only expecting uh
15:17:14
prompts that have this information. If it's um something way out of left field, we should not send this forward. And
15:17:20
again, there's a threshold over here that we can start tweaking with. And I would test this out. And you know, the
15:17:27
clear example, and I've talked about this also in the guards video, is if you go to a Gentic Arena, and I think it was
15:17:33
like tacos, tacos, tacos. Uh this would have stopped that from happening. Uh
15:17:38
going to other things as well. Over here we have URLs. So you could block all URLs except. So imagine you're having
15:17:45
issues with the website and you just want people to post like specific page on the site or something like that. So
15:17:51
you would want to block all URLs except uh then we have custom side and regx. So
15:17:57
you can set up custom rules as necessary. So again, if it fails a rule, it goes down over here. You should log
15:18:02
why it failed. you should send a message to someone and then you have the AI agent if it specifically passes. The
15:18:08
other side of it is sanitizing. So this will actually remove specific text. So
15:18:14
you can see we can remove PII data. So going back over here like this could be either a guardrail check for violations
15:18:21
or we just remove that information. So imagine if someone's just having issues with their credit card. Uh if you're a
15:18:28
company like Visa, if someone uh sends in their credit card number, which they shouldn't just paste their credit card
15:18:34
number, but um regardless if they paste their credit card number into a form, we sanitize that text so that way it
15:18:40
doesn't get sent into our large language model. Same with an API key. Imagine you have some type of SAS product and you
15:18:46
offer an API and someone just paste in their API key and say, "Hey, I'm having an issue." Maybe you want to uh sanitize
15:18:51
a text and remove it. So you can see that is an option over there. You have other URLs and custom regx so you can
15:18:57
change things as necessary. So that is guardrails. Super important note. I'm
15:19:03
really glad that N added that in and uh that is one of the first parts of security and compliance. Another one
15:19:10
that we've already talked about are different user roles. So specifically in
15:19:15
chat hub and we can go back to chat hub settings over here and go into chat as
15:19:21
well as users. So if you don't need a user to have access to everything, you
15:19:26
could just go over here and invite a user and you give them a role of a specific chat user. Not everyone needs
15:19:32
to be a member or a specific admin. Admin has permissions to everything. Member has permissions to things that
15:19:38
you share. Chat user only has access to ChatHub. So if you don't want them if you don't want a user to have access to
15:19:44
your workflows, but still to be able to use them, you can use a chat user. And
15:19:49
think about this real world scenario. When you're working with databases, you have people that have write access and
15:19:54
you have people that have read access. Obviously, there are certain people like the data engineers that should have write access. Some data scientists
15:20:00
should have right access. They're building out some sort of table. But someone that just needs to query the data and should not be manipulating the
15:20:07
data should only have read access. So this is one way that we could control that. In addition with chat, you can
15:20:13
specify what models are available. So you can go in over here and this is another form of security. Um you might
15:20:20
say, for example, hey, I only want US-based models for this company. It might be a rule that your security team
15:20:26
set up. So you inside of chat, you just only available the US-based companies.
15:20:31
So you can't use something like a deepseek. So that is chat. Next, we're
15:20:36
going to talk about web hooks. And we've already covered web hook security, but inside web hooks, if you have a live web
15:20:43
hook, you need to set up some sort of authentication. So this way, someone has some sort of API key or username and
15:20:50
password to access your web hook. It is super important because you wear web hooks when they go into a production URL
15:20:56
and you make your workflow live, anyone can access those. So again on the security side we've already covered this
15:21:02
but make sure you either set up basic off header off or JWT O and build out those credentials over here. Uh again
15:21:10
very important and you can also build out other ways to block people after they get in through this web hook. So
15:21:17
that is web hook side of things. Credential management and going back into NE and we can go back in over here
15:21:24
and go to our homepage. You can see there's credentials over here. So on the credential management side of things,
15:21:30
what you should do is first be clear with what the credentials are. I did not
15:21:36
do this initially, but let's say for example, you have multiple credentials for a company, you have credentials for
15:21:43
a marketing department, you have credentials for engineering department and IT department. World scenario,
15:21:48
people are on different billing. Uh a company when it gets larger isn't going to just have one credit card for
15:21:53
everything. Departments have their budgets. So if you're working with multiple departments, make sure you label these clearly. For example, uh
15:22:00
what you might have is a Google Drive account for marketing. So you might say Google Drive marketing or Google Drive
15:22:06
engineering and be super explicit. You can also share these. So you can go over here and it says change owner and you
15:22:14
can change the owner specifically on here. You can go over here and give access to people as well. So uh that is
15:22:21
the credential side of things. Uh next we're going to talk about version controls. So in nan when we publish so
15:22:29
we'll save and we publish and obviously like these need no these have some issues. So maybe I don't want to set
15:22:36
that up specifically right now. Let me uh turn these off
15:22:42
so that way I don't have any issues. I'm just going to add in a chat model over here. Doesn't really matter too much. I
15:22:49
just want to be able to publish this. All right. Save. Is this going to let me
15:22:54
publish it? Oh, I need a trigger. All right, let's imagine this is our
15:23:00
workflow has no trigger nodes that require publishing. Oh, you know what I need?
15:23:06
Let's put this web hook over here and activate it. Well, let's not use a web hook. We're
15:23:12
going to use a schedule trigger. This should be fine.
15:23:18
Once I go to the schedule trigger and push this over here, we're going to be able to publish this. So, another thing
15:23:24
that you can have is version control. So, you want to specify your version of
15:23:29
something. So, let's say I'm going to publish this. I'm going to say section 25 version one or like you can put like V1
15:23:37
and I say added schedule trigger. Like you need to be explicit on what is
15:23:42
changing in your workflow. You need to put your notes over here as well. This is very similar to how GitHub works. So,
15:23:49
ideally what happens is someone's going to take a look at the different versions and see if things are changing or not.
15:23:56
Um, in terms of like compliance and things like that, it is super important to have your different versioning and what is changing as well because
15:24:02
regulators are going to ask for that. So, one way we can do versioning is directly here in any now with publish.
15:24:10
So, this is pretty awesome on this side of things and you can see there's a whole production checklist. I'm not
15:24:15
going to go through that. However, um you can go through that as well if you want to. And you can see section 25V1
15:24:22
published just now. And I believe you can also see the version history as well. So if I go to settings,
15:24:29
I want to say there's an option for that too to see a version history. Either way, it is super important to have that
15:24:35
as a a backup as well, just in case like there's something wrong with your NAN account. I would probably recommend that
15:24:42
you set up GitHub as well and do the same exact thing. I would just download your workflow as JSON. So, if you go
15:24:48
over here to the three dots, you can go and just download this and you'll see it security and compliance over here. And I
15:24:54
would just upload these into your GitHub account. Do the same exact thing. Keep your versions uh update your change log
15:25:00
within GitHub. Just really, really critical that you have your versioning history. especially if something just
15:25:06
completely breaks in your workflow. You can go back to a previous version and then work on that specific or particular
15:25:12
bug. So that is versioning. It's obviously built in directly into nan. I would highly highly suggest that you
15:25:18
also back up your very important workflows within GitHub. All right. Next
15:25:25
concept I wanted to cover really fast I want to say is logging. And I actually have some nodes associated with that. So
15:25:33
we're going to jump into that here in a second. All right, I am back. So another thing to mention is just like logging
15:25:39
what is going on. I already showed you how we could do this in evaluations, but you can also build out a JavaScript node
15:25:46
over here and get other additional information that you might find helpful for just logging what is going on.
15:25:52
Logging is a concept that comes from software engineering and it's important to do. So what I have over here is the
15:25:58
time stamp, the workflow ID, workflow name, execution ID, execution mode, uh the user that's going through this, the
15:26:04
instance ID, and other pieces of information that might be helpful. So if I execute this step, you'll see that we
15:26:11
essentially create a table. So it says timestamp, I'm recording this here on the first, the workflow ID associated
15:26:17
with it, the name, execution, execution mode. I'm obviously in test mode right now, so you can log whether you're in
15:26:22
test mode or you're in production. How many items are in getting inputed? Obviously, I have no items, so that's why we have one over here. The workflow
15:26:29
is not active, so it's on false. The time zone over here, which I'm not sure why we're in UTC, but that's okay. And
15:26:34
then we have a log ID. So, highly recommend that you set up logging. Obviously, you can just copy what I have
15:26:40
over here and just paste this into your workflow. And then what you can do is have this added to Sheets after. We've
15:26:46
already covered Google Sheets so many times, so I'm not going to spend the time and actually add it in, but just go
15:26:51
over here, append. I wouldn't say append or update to just append it when this runs. Okay, cool. We've logged it and
15:26:58
this is populated in Google Sheets. Uh you can also log it in other locations instead of sheets. I just mentioned
15:27:04
this. The proper way would probably be to log it within a database. So I would recommend that you have logging tables
15:27:10
for again critical workflows. Log that in your database. If you don't have a database set up, you can use sheets, you
15:27:16
could use air table, you could use the native data tables here in N. Logging is a really important thing when it comes
15:27:22
to security and compliance because people need to see what is particularly going on. Um, okay. So, we've talked
15:27:29
about users, we've talked about PII handling, we've talked about web hook security,
15:27:35
uh, version control. Obviously, you have this over here directly for um, and the
15:27:41
versioning as well as um, in GitHub. Again, you can just go over here and say like
15:27:48
section 25 So I've version two added logging code node. So it's another
15:27:57
option over there and boom. So now you can see section 25 just published now.
15:28:02
Oh, you can go here to workflow history and you can take a look at different versions too. So you can see I have
15:28:08
section 25 version one. I knew I I was going to show it to you guys and I apologize for going the wrong area, but you can see this is prior to me saving
15:28:15
this. Then you have version one and then over here version two. It says version history is limited to one days. Upgrade
15:28:21
plan to activate full history, which is kind of sucky. So, make sure to put this up in GitHub since it's only one day,
15:28:28
but you can see we have this published on here for version two. Uh, so my GitHub thing, definitely do that,
15:28:34
especially if you're on a lower tier account like I am. All right, naming conventions. It's also important to just
15:28:39
name your nodes on that side. We've talked about naming nodes. Just be explicit.
15:28:45
um not really security and compliance side of things but obviously if you can't read what's going on in a workflow
15:28:51
uh that's important it's more this naming convention is more focused on the credentials itself building out
15:28:57
documentation is another part of security and compliance so on the documentation side what do you need for
15:29:03
documentation well what I would recommend documentation is onementation
15:29:08
one add in add in sticky notes like this like this. I would also
15:29:16
mention that you need to have like a Google doc, notion or whatever type of document you need to
15:29:23
explain what is going on in the workflow. Regulators sometimes will ask for that type of stuff. Again, depends
15:29:28
on your industry if you have regulation or not. Um, in addition, I think it's
15:29:33
super easy just to add in a Loom video, Loom or YouTube video, just walking through what is going on. Uh, assuming
15:29:40
they have like 80 90% of it done. Obviously you can update it if you have some major changes but that's the type
15:29:45
of documentation I would recommend and uh really sticky notes is directly in any end the Google doc kind of just
15:29:52
explains at a high level you have screenshots and kind of explains some of the additional logic outside of here and
15:29:58
then you have aloom or YouTube so that's external documentation and I should just say um well you have the internal with
15:30:04
the sticky notes and then you have external for these last two all right
15:30:10
can also let's take a look at anything else. I think we're pretty good over here on
15:30:16
that side of things. One other thing to mention, I I did talk about GitHub, but you could also store these
15:30:23
workflows in Google Drive. So, you could just save the JSON automatically and populate this to Google Drive and you
15:30:29
can do like a daily backup. So, maybe you want to have a daily backup on Google Drive. So like daily backup
15:30:37
Google Drive or just a oneoff or one off for this. So again you can use Google
15:30:44
Drive or GitHub. And I think that is essentially it for security and
15:30:49
compliance. Obviously like I don't know everything about security and and compliance but because obviously I don't
15:30:57
do it for a living but just coming from the payments industry this is some of the things that we personally require to
15:31:04
build out workflows. So guardrails super super important. Make sure naming conventions correct. Make sure user
15:31:10
management is correct. If you want to log your workflows like essentially just copy what I have in this code node. make
15:31:16
sure that you have backups either in Google Drive, GitHub, and then versioning is important. Obviously on
15:31:21
here with my plan, versioning is only limited to one day, which is really a bummer. So I would recommend you just do
15:31:26
versioning on GitHub right now. I would hope that at some point in the future, and I don't know if any team will do it,
15:31:32
when you publish these and set up versions, you could also just automatically send this to GitHub. I think that'd be a really, really cool
15:31:37
feature, but I just don't see them doing that. And then lastly, documentation. Put documentation internally into the
15:31:43
workflow. add documentation to like a Google doc or notion page and add in a loom or YouTube video just kind of
15:31:50
walking through things and that is going to be our section on security and
15:31:55
compliance. All right, so next I believe we are jumping into uh MCP and I will
15:32:00
see you there. So for section 26 we're going to make this into a two-part
15:32:06
video. The first part is going to be focusing on the instance level MCP. So what this allows us to do is connect our
15:32:13
NAN workflows directly to third parties that support the NAN MCP connection. So
15:32:20
recently Lovable has added this in as well as Claude. So I'm going to be
15:32:25
showing you how we could do this in cloud. We'll do Lovable a little bit later when we talk about building out interfaces. Uh the second part is just
15:32:32
going to be talking about MCP as a technology in general and we'll also uh go through a workflow and some of the
15:32:37
nodes associated with that. uh when we jump into there. But the first part, let's focus on the instance level and
15:32:43
get this connected directly into cloud and we'll start there. Okay. So, I'm going to show you a few things before we
15:32:50
actually uh build out a workflow. So, the first thing is we need to add a first step and there's only a few
15:32:56
different triggers that you can use currently with MCP. So, the first one is our chat trigger. So, that is one
15:33:03
option. The next is going to be a web hook. So, we go to web hook like this. That is another option we could use. We
15:33:10
could use a schedule, a schedule trigger as well as a form trigger. So before
15:33:17
even deciding if you want to go NCP or not with your workflow, you have to make sure that your workflow starts with one
15:33:24
of these four triggers. Now, I'm just going to use this chat trigger right now just for some testing purposes. I don't
15:33:30
know if this will be the actual workflow we utilize in this example, but let's just assume we're having that. Okay,
15:33:37
next step. What we're going to do, I'm just going to add in a very basic AI agent because it's so common to have a
15:33:42
chat into an AI agent. And what we're going to do is just add a chat model. I'm going to add in Anthropic since it's all the way here at the top. Very simple
15:33:49
workflow. So, I'm going to save this workflow. The next step is you have to have your workflow published to enable
15:33:55
MCP. So, I'm going to click publish over here and we'll have our different version name, whatever the case may be.
15:34:02
So, that's fine. We're going to publish it. Got it. Okay, next. These two are
15:34:07
going to be in parallel. So, the first thing what we want to do is make sure we have our MCP settings correct. So, if
15:34:13
you go to this gear icon to the bottom left and you choose instance level MCP,
15:34:18
make sure that your MCP is enabled. So, I have two workflows right now that are MCP. I'm just going to remove access
15:34:25
right now just for testing purposes and we'll disable it. So, yours probably looks like this and it says connect AI
15:34:31
assistance to your workflow. Enable MCP access. So you can click that or just turn this on over here. So now that this
15:34:38
is particularly enabled. So you should be fine there. So your next step is to
15:34:43
go into these three dots over here and then click into settings. And you'll see
15:34:48
I already have this available in MCP by default. You'll have it turned off. Then you turn this back on over here. So I'm
15:34:54
going to click save. And maybe lost because someone else just updated this workflow. All right. So, I'm just going
15:35:01
to refresh this really quick because I accidentally updated it elsewhere. Not a
15:35:06
big deal. All right. So, three dots settings and we're going to say this is
15:35:12
available in MCP. Cool. Now, the workflow is saved and we are good to go.
15:35:17
If we go back to this instance level MCP and I refresh it because I deleted these other ones, you'll see we just have this
15:35:24
initial one out of the gate and this was initial kind of description I was thinking about for this workflow. You
15:35:29
might change it out, but by default, you'll probably have an empty description. Just go over here and click edit description. Write your description
15:35:36
for the workflow because essentially what you're going to be doing is prompting uh and saying what workflow
15:35:42
you want to use for a specific use case. And your description is really important. You can think of this as like a tool call when you're working with an
15:35:48
AI agent. I mentioned how the descriptions are important. So, build this out. Obviously, this is pretty vague, but it'll be fine for our demo
15:35:55
example. If you want to remove access, uh there's two different routes you could go. You could remove access over
15:36:01
here or you could go back over here and then uh remove access. So you just go into the settings and available in MCP
15:36:09
that is turned off. Okay, pretty basic on that side of things. And then now
15:36:14
what I'm going to do is show you really quick how to set up everything on Claude and uh then we'll build out our
15:36:21
workflow. To set this up directly in Claude, what we're going to do first is click this plus icon and then you'll see
15:36:26
over here it says add connectors. Then what we're going to do is search directly for N. Now it's a pretty
15:36:32
popular one. So I would assume it's towards the top. If you don't see that though, you can just go over here and
15:36:38
search and type in N. And you'll see INA over here. It says access and run your
15:36:44
NEN workflows. So click plus and it says get a URL from N. So you can click on
15:36:50
that right over here. This will load up over here. My internet's a little slow right now. It
15:36:56
might take a second. All right. So that link over here goes accessing N MCP server. There's a little bit more about
15:37:03
it. Over here it says instance level MCP. Enable it which we already have that enabled. So I showed you that a
15:37:09
little bit earlier. And then it says list of workflows etc. on that side of things. And uh over here a little bit
15:37:17
more information settings instance level MCPS uh to get actual stuff over here it
15:37:22
says connected clients no ooth collected clients that connect via oath will show up here see connection instructions. So
15:37:28
this actually will give us our URL that we need. I kind of wish it actually brought us over here but that's okay.
15:37:34
We'll click copy and we will go back into claude over here. We'll say paste
15:37:40
the server URL. So that is that URL. So again to get to there I just went to settings bottom right instance level MCP
15:37:47
and then you go to connected clients see connection instructions and I'll give you this over here. Then I just go back
15:37:54
over here. I click continue and it says grant access to any complete the signin steps and it brought me to this screen.
15:38:01
Cloud wants to access your nan instance. Get a list of your workflows. Get details for specific workflows. Execute
15:38:06
workflows on your behalf. We're going to click allow. It says success. you will be soon redirected back to the client.
15:38:12
And then we get brought back in over here and then we have this icon over here that says connected to an AI. All
15:38:19
right, so I'm testing this now. First, I made one minor change. So in my workflow, I deleted the other triggers.
15:38:25
I went to OpenAI chat model. I used GPT5 Mini and I'm using web search. We're going to go the college football playoff
15:38:31
route. And you'll see I said use N workflow section 26 to get University of Miami college football score. It says
15:38:38
cloud wants you to search workflows from any end query section 26. I'm going to say allow once. Now it's going to search
15:38:43
for my workflows. And uh we'll see. I found the workflow. Let me get details to execute it.
15:38:51
Again, we'll just say allow once. We should probably allow always, but I'm just putting this allow
15:38:57
once just to show you what it looks like on my screen. Next, I'll execute the workflow to get University of Miami
15:39:02
college football scores. And uh we're doing chat chat input. was University of Miami College football
15:39:09
score and allow once and it's executing my workflow right now. We'll take a look at the executions here in a second.
15:39:17
Workflow is asking for clarification. Let me specify that we want the University Football and Hurricanes over
15:39:22
here. Yep, that's fine. One of the things I noticed too when you use Open
15:39:29
AI with chat is it will always ask you more clarifying questions. So, you can
15:39:34
prompt it and say not to ask so many clarifying questions. I bet you it comes back.
15:39:41
Yep, it's going to keep asking it. It's because I wrote a bad prompt, but that's okay. We'll say that's fine.
15:39:48
And I didn't even put memory on here, so it's probably going to have some issues. But you see, it's going back and forth
15:39:54
now with our MCP. And uh
15:40:00
I swear if it comes back with another question, I'm just going to stop it. We're going to rerun it and I'm going to be more specific.
15:40:07
All right, here we go. Look at that. Great news. Here's the score.
15:40:13
And uh that was yesterday.
15:40:22
Check this out. So, great news. Here's the University of Miami Cultural Ball score from the N workflow. Miami Hurricanes 24, Ohio State 14. Most
15:40:29
recent game, the workflow used web search. And literally all I did is I used a chat trigger over here. I used an
15:40:35
AI agent. I'd even add in additional prompts which I would recommend if you're building out something crazy that
15:40:41
you do that something crazy something you push forward. And then you have open AI use GPT5 mini and covered responses
15:40:47
that we did earlier. And all I did on this side of things is use this workflow to get upate information about cultural publics. Again, I could prompt this,
15:40:54
write a wig better system message that I put in a college and essentially I want to get the latest college football score
15:41:02
based around it with this workflow and have this do this correctly in Claude. And I also changed the model for two
15:41:09
reasons. Number one, to show you I'm running an OpenAI chat model in Claude and also to use responses to get the
15:41:16
latest score. Obviously, you can add in way more complicated things in over here as well, but yeah, it's going to be
15:41:22
quite easy. We're actually going to expand on this into the next section as well when we cover into front ends. I
15:41:29
just quickly also wanted to show you um there is an MCP tool available in any.
15:41:35
So, kind of MCPS are going the route of like APIs for AI and we can go over here
15:41:42
and search for MCP. So MCP client tool and you see what we have over here is a
15:41:48
specific endpoint and you only have HTTP streamable right now. Unfortunately this
15:41:53
is quite limited on the cloud side of things. When you go into self-hosted you have a lot more options rather than HTTP
15:42:02
streamable but it'll give you a specific endpoint and when you work with MCP
15:42:07
it'll give you a specific endpoint to call to. It'll tell you the server transport over here if there's any
15:42:13
authentication that is needed and then you can specify every single tool that's available in the MCP server selected
15:42:20
ones all or accept. So essentially what MCP looks like on the NEN side of
15:42:25
things. Let me just show you. There's like an MCP trigger and this is your MCP client.
15:42:32
There's the MCP trigger.
15:42:43
And you'll notice over here we have different tools. So when you're connecting to a company's MCP server,
15:42:50
typically they'll have different tools that you could use. In a case, let's say, for example, we want to build one directly in an AN. We can set up an MCP
15:42:58
server trigger to have multiple Gmail tools. So, Gmail has quite a bit of tools as we
15:43:06
saw and you can see if I go to my Gmail account one can set tool descriptions
15:43:12
and then resource like let's say message like we have all these over here label
15:43:17
we have all these over here draft so each tool is like one specific action that you could perform in Gmail and in
15:43:24
the real world let's say for example fireall they have an MCP server so if I
15:43:30
go to fireall All these tools are most likely available in the MCP of Firecol. And
15:43:37
just to show you, I'm going to load this up on another tab. Firecrawl MCP.
15:43:43
All right. So, take a look at this. This is documentation again. Firewall MCP
15:43:49
server. Use Firewall's API through MCP. So, MCP server inte implements
15:43:54
integrates firewall for web scraping capabilities. RCP server is open source. So installation you can either use a
15:44:01
remote hosted URL server will look like or you get your API key from over here remote hosted URL. So they have a URL on
15:44:08
this side of it as well that you would want to set up. And essentially what you
15:44:14
could do and I'm going to cover this actually in another video for Firewall MCP
15:44:19
but um going into this MCP client this works best on um self-hosted but you
15:44:25
would set this up and go through it. Actually, I think I did fire call MCP when we were talking about it in our
15:44:31
self-hosted video here on YouTube for MCP, but a little bit outside the scope on this one. Just wanted to show you MCP
15:44:37
instance level. You can use these workflows and connect to it outside of
15:44:43
NAN. Inside NAN as well, you can create your own MCP server. Uh you would have your MCP server trigger and you can see
15:44:49
we have a URL over here and you can actually connect that over here as well. So, like imagine you have one workflow
15:44:56
that just has like 10 tools that you think, okay, these are the only tools I'm going to use in Gmail. Instead of
15:45:01
having 10 tools over here, which again, I don't recommend having a ton of tools, but if instead of having 10 tools, you
15:45:06
can just use the 10 tools um from this MCP server. So, you can just click this.
15:45:13
See, we can just set that up in over here. And then you can define what tools you specifically want because by default
15:45:19
it's all. You could choose selected um and or you can go over all accept. Obviously I didn't set this up in
15:45:26
another workflow so we're going to have some issues over there but yeah that is kind of MCP. So instance level use NAN
15:45:35
workflow outside of NAN, right? And then you also inside NAN you have MCP server
15:45:42
trigger which could have multiple tools that you attach to your AI agent. Cover this in way greater detail inside our
15:45:49
MCP video. Uh so I would check that out. And uh yeah, next video what we're going
15:45:54
to do is cover specifically rag. Now, rag could be a five to 10 hour video if
15:46:01
we talked about all the nuances. So, I'll get you going with the basics on that side of things. What I'd recommend
15:46:06
for you guys to do kind of like as a homework assignment over here, build a workflow like test these out with the
15:46:12
different triggers and uh test it out specifically with Claude. So, this next
15:46:18
section is going to be talk about adding a front end to a N workflow. There's pretty much three quick ways that you
15:46:24
could utilize this. The first one is going to use chatub. And we've already covered chat hub a lot. So I'm not going
15:46:30
to rehash our chatub section, but ideally if you want to have something natively in any ad and people can't see
15:46:36
your workflows, chat hub is going to be one of the best approaches. Now if you want to add bit more to the complexity
15:46:43
side of things, one of the things that I use at my full-time job is going to be Streamllet. So essentially what you can
15:46:48
have is a web interface that is hosted on Streamllet's website for free. And
15:46:54
you build this out with Python code. And if you don't know Python, don't worry. You can vibe code a lot of this with a
15:47:00
large language model and just do some minor tweaking with the Python code. Although I do recommend that you learn
15:47:05
Python. But essentially what this allows you to do is build a quick interface. And I've done this quite a bit with
15:47:12
internal Python applications as well as Streamlit apps. So you have the interface and you send a web hook over
15:47:18
into the N and then you perform specific actions. But what was really cool also
15:47:23
about Streamlit is you can filter your data before it even goes into NAN and
15:47:28
then you can send a response back if you would like. Um a little bit more complicated on that side of things, but
15:47:34
you have to understand the web hook component of it. You're going to have to understand um any type of data cleanup that you specifically need, but that is
15:47:41
available. And then lastly, we can use MCP and use a builder such as Lovable to
15:47:46
create a front end for us. Now, there's going to be an additional cost associated with it because um they
15:47:52
aren't always free, but that is a third approach that we could specifically take. So, I'm not going to do ChatHub,
15:47:58
but I want to show you Streamlit right now. So, I'm just going into Streamlit
15:48:03
over here. And this is a Python library, and they have constant updates. You can see date and time widget over here. And
15:48:10
just to show you what this looks like, literally just a few lines of Python code. You have something like this, my first app, hello world. And uh it says
15:48:18
right over here, trust by 90% of Fortune50 companies. And you can see like it's very easy
15:48:25
code. And you build these interfaces like this. And it's and I'm just dragging and dropping this over here.
15:48:31
You can browse files and upload the files. But this is just like a a really enhanced form that you could utilize um
15:48:38
outside of any and obviously just you need a web hook call to populate this. So you can see what's going on over
15:48:45
there and deploy instantly. So it says deploy streamllet community cloud which I've used go snowflake for
15:48:50
enterprisegrade deployment or something else. And you can employ uh streamlit apps within AWS. You could do digital
15:48:57
ocean and these are examples of apps that people have made. These are just data apps. And again, you could have a
15:49:03
section that uh sends it directly into any end. I actually have a full video on
15:49:08
my YouTube channel covering how to build out Streamlit within any end, but it's like an hour long, hour and a half. I
15:49:14
know we don't have an hour and a half to talk about that today. And I don't know how many people are going to be interested in it, but let's take a look
15:49:19
at a few other things. So, this would be like a Seattle weather dashboard. Let's take a look at this road map or a to-do
15:49:25
list. And these are demos that people have created or demos that any has. So you can essentially build a dashboard
15:49:31
and maybe you have a button over here that says send to Nan and you send it to N and it performs some sort of action.
15:49:37
Uh here is a road map. Okay, I think this might actually be the N road map. So here's a to-do list. So you could
15:49:43
have even a to-do list like as soon as someone checks something off then it goes and performs an action with a hand
15:49:49
workflow. You can add things in over here. Um let's say record 15hour video
15:49:56
and uh that has been added over here. delete all that are checked. So, you can delete this. So, pretty cool on the web
15:50:02
app side of things. You don't always need to essentially use a lovable if you just want to have a basic interface. Uh
15:50:09
let's take a look at some other stuff. I actually watch this YouTuber for streamlight content. Um let's add a few
15:50:15
others. I think I read I think he has a book. I can't remember that was his stream book
15:50:21
or not. Yeah. So, you can see you have a sidebar over here with different actions. you
15:50:26
have notes like there's just so many different components and I'll just go to the component store so you guys can see
15:50:32
over here as well you can add in plots grids there is a ton going on um yeah so that
15:50:40
is streamlin essentially you can build out an interface with python code and uh essentially all you have to do is set it
15:50:46
up a web hook web hook goes into nan and starts the specific workflow and
15:50:52
obviously you can track things you can add a database here's a source code you can see some of the different options.
15:50:57
So you can put in charts directly in over here. Like there's just so much that you could do with it. And uh yeah,
15:51:03
so that's our first option. I just downloaded a remove background from
15:51:08
image. Interesting. All right. So first side of it. The other I just wanted to quickly show you is Lovable. Now I have
15:51:15
never used Lovable. This is going to be my first time. So we will uh we'll see how it goes. And I'm just going to click
15:51:22
over here and let's see. We'll get log in
15:51:28
with Google. We'll test this out.
15:51:37
If it's free, I will uh test this out. We'll use dark mode. And uh all right.
15:51:43
So, let's see if we can attach this into any end. We have
15:51:48
I don't know how many credits we have, but we are going to try this. We're going to go to connectors, manage
15:51:54
connectors, and we're going to look for N. So, we see N over here, and I'm going to say
15:52:00
connect. Now, I need to get this N link again. So, I'm going to go over here and
15:52:05
say connect. Grab this URL. Go back in over here, add an authorize.
15:52:12
It's going to load this up for OOTH. Allow. And you can see MCP is super easy to set
15:52:18
up. So, we have that over here. Great. And I'm going to say
15:52:27
go over here. Is it still section 26? Okay, cool. For section
15:52:35
for section 26, build a user interface
15:52:41
where someone can ask about a football score.
15:52:50
end workflow will then find the score and send it
15:52:57
back. And I should say about a college football score.
15:53:02
All right, let's give it a shot. I have no idea how long this will take. I don't know if I have enough credits, but uh we
15:53:07
will see what happens. So, it is now thinking I assume this is
15:53:14
going to take a few minutes. It says I'll build a slate college football over here. search workflows. Um, we're going
15:53:20
to ask each time. We're just going to say allow. Obviously, you can automate this as well. I just want to show you
15:53:25
the questions it's going to ask me. So, it's going to search for these. Get workflow details. I'm going to click
15:53:31
allow. Cool. So, it's saying what it's going to do. Dark theme with vibrant orange and gold accent. Football energy.
15:53:37
Bold condensed typography. Card based results with subtle animations. Load states with pulse effects. So, hopefully
15:53:44
this works correctly. This is pretty cool to see. Obviously, I really haven't dove in on this side of things as of
15:53:51
yet, but we'll see how it goes. All right, so now we have this interface
15:53:56
over here. College football scorefinder powered by AI, real time scores, and playoff updates. All right, so we
15:54:03
already have what is the score of the Ohio State who won Texas versus Georgia.
15:54:08
Ohio State won was last night. We put that over here. Oh, that's Ohio State Notre Dame. This is still a little bit
15:54:14
behind. What was the score of the Ohio State versus Miami game? Miami game.
15:54:20
We're going to search it over here and let's see what happens. Now, this I will say looks amazing right out of the gate
15:54:30
and it says query what was the score of Miami game to get real scores. Then workflow will be executed with your
15:54:36
information. The AI agent will search update playoff information results workflow. So, it's interesting. Oh, I
15:54:43
have to click allow. I'm like, where are we going to get the results back? But we're going to click allow over here and
15:54:49
we'll see it coming back. But this is really cool. Obviously, I don't know if
15:54:55
all the code in the back end is correct. I'm not a front-end engineer, but it's asking a clarifying question. Let me
15:55:01
provide a little bit more. Let's say allow. What is the question we're going to get
15:55:06
back? I did update the prompt a little bit. I
15:55:13
didn't go um full detail, but just to show you really quick.
15:55:21
This is the new uh system message I put. Obviously, I would change this up completely for another one. Workflow
15:55:28
works and return Ohio State defeated Notre Dame. Now, I need to enable lovable cloud so we can create an edge
15:55:34
function that will call the workflow from the front end. Let's click allow. But why didn't it present the results
15:55:41
over here? I wonder if it's just because of some settings. Um, I mean, again, this design looks
15:55:48
nice, but I want to see like if I type this in, I want the results to be right
15:55:53
here because it says score results over here. It just gives me this.
15:56:01
Okay. So, I think this is going through and editing this now. I never added any
15:56:07
credit card information or anything like that. So, I don't even know the pricing. We can take a look at pricing here in a
15:56:12
second. And it looks like it's going through again. And uh we'll check it one more time once
15:56:19
this goes through. I think there's some games going on now as well. Let me just double check. There's three games going
15:56:24
on today. I want to say football scores. I haven't even seen them because I've been busy recording. All right. Oregon's
15:56:31
winning 23 nothing right now. Let's see what's else going on.
15:56:38
Alabama Indiana starts in 30 minutes and then misses later versus Georgia. So,
15:56:44
we'll test uh the Oregon Texas Tech. Oh, it's over Oregon one.
15:56:50
All right, this is editing right now. I'll tech. We'll test this one for next
15:56:56
one. It is still going. It's taking a
15:57:03
screenshot, it says. All right, it says it is ready. Cool.
15:57:10
So, I think we're ready to test it. Okay.
15:57:15
So, what is the Oregon
15:57:21
Texas Tech score? Let's see what happens this
15:57:26
time. So, I'm going to search it. Score result. Your query would be processed by the Nan workflow. I guess I have to
15:57:33
allow this again. I don't know. I feel like I'm missing something.
15:57:40
Feel like I'm missing something. Unless I have to preview it out over here.
15:57:53
Says search information retrieved. Let's see executions.
15:58:00
So this is our execution and this came directly from over there.
15:58:05
I don't see the execution of the one that I just tested. You can see the other execution.
15:58:13
Which do you mean football or basketball? You have a date or season in mind. Most recent. I should say latest
15:58:19
as a prompt. And I say that over here. I guess I need
15:58:24
to say do not ask for flying questions. Do not ask
15:58:30
questions. This happens all the time with GPT five. We'll save this over here. You
15:58:35
know what the other thing is? I didn't publish the latest version. That's probably why. Easy mistake. Either way,
15:58:42
this was building out a front end. Obviously, you can still constantly mess with it and test it out. But just wanted
15:58:50
to show you a few different approaches. Chatub, you could use Streamlit or you could use a tool like Lovable to build
15:58:56
this out. Obviously, if you're using Lovable, check your work, make sure it is correct. I I think this is a really
15:59:01
cool design that it built out right away. All right, so next one we're going to jump into is Rag. Keep up the great
15:59:08
work. We're almost done with this course and I will see you in the next video. So for this section, we're going to be covering something called retrieval
15:59:13
augmented generation. Everyone calls it rag because that is a wordful and I'm
15:59:19
just going to continue to call it rag from here on out. So, if I was going to make a full section covered about Rag
15:59:26
and all the different types of vector databases and all the technical components about it and where the future of Rag is heading towards, that video
15:59:33
will easily be three, four, five plus hours, if not longer. And because this
15:59:39
course is really focused on teaching you the basics of NE, I am not going to do that in this section. In fact, this is
15:59:45
probably going to be a follow-up course here on the channel if there's enough interest about it. Again, there's just
15:59:51
so many different types of techniques. There's so many types of vector databases and it would be very tough to cram all that into one specific video
15:59:58
over here when we're covering the basics of all these different types of sections. So, if you do want to learn a
16:00:03
little bit more about Rag and you're interested in that course, just let me know down below in the comment section. I'm really inclined to make it. I think
16:00:11
it would be a really fun and interesting video as well. But over here, what we're going to do is a very basic rag
16:00:17
tutorial. First, what we're going to cover is how you can use your own data simply with Open AI. And that's going to
16:00:25
be probably the easiest way for you to get started with Rag. And then we're going to cover a more advanced rag
16:00:31
pipeline as well as uh uploading data, embedding it, and and different things like that. Now, what is the real purpose
16:00:38
of rag? I haven't even really talked about that. So, our AI agents, we already know that there's a limitation
16:00:44
sometimes on uh the knowledge based off of the knowledge cut off date. So if you're working with AI agents, sometimes
16:00:49
they only have knowledge up through 2024 or specific time in 2025. However, one
16:00:55
big glaring issue with AI agents and other AI nodes, they just don't have
16:01:00
access to personal data. Every single company has SOPs, or at least I'd hope
16:01:05
that they do, and data that is not public online. And because of that,
16:01:11
these AI agents are not trained on it. These AI agents essentially are trained on scraped data online. And because
16:01:17
companies have their own internal policies or internal procedures, they just don't have that specific knowledge.
16:01:24
So, Rag essentially helps AI agents with personal information for a company,
16:01:30
which really empowers them a lot because why you want to have an AI agent? You want to have them take action based off
16:01:37
of your own specific policies in most cases. So essentially by building out something pretty thorough with rag,
16:01:44
you're going to give specific context to an AI agent based off information that is held within a vector database. Now
16:01:52
what a vector database is, you can store different types of files directly in
16:01:58
there. And uh you'll be doing this through something called a pipeline. And
16:02:03
essentially what happens over there is someone will upload a file. We're going to embed the specific file. Don't worry,
16:02:09
we're going to go over all the details about embedding and how a pipeline works. But regardless, someone uploads a
16:02:15
file, we're going to embed the file, and then we're going to populate it within a vector store. And this is going to be
16:02:22
really fun to cover. I am going to give you a little bit of warning. This is probably one of the more technical
16:02:27
components of this video. And don't worry if Rag doesn't click right away.
16:02:32
All you need to know is that Rag essentially improves our agents with private data. So let's jump into a very
16:02:40
basic example with OpenAI. Then let's take a look at building out a pipeline
16:02:45
and uh utilizing it in practice. So I'm in Nan now. I want to show you guys
16:02:50
first the most basic form of ARG and we're going to be using Open AI for this. So essentially OpenAI has a super
16:02:58
easy way where all we have to do is upload a file and it does all of the work for us. Now it is a little bit
16:03:04
pricey. Uh, so you get charged 10 cents per day once you have over a gigabyte worth of files over here. And I believe
16:03:11
it's 10 cents per gigabyte as well. So let me show you first where you could access this. So go to platform.openai.com/hat.
16:03:19
And then we go over here on that side of things. And what we're going to want to do is go specifically into storage. So
16:03:27
now we have storage on here. And then we're going to want to go to our vector stores. So we have our vector stores
16:03:33
like this. The first thing that we need to do is create a vector store. So we're going to create this over here. And
16:03:40
let's set a name for this. Now I'm going to call this old judge. And I'll explain why in a second. So we have old judge
16:03:46
over here. And then I'm going to click this icon. So it says vector storevs has
16:03:52
been updated. Now we don't have any particular files in here. So let me show you the file which we're going to be
16:03:57
using for this particular video. So, I found this article over here talking about old judge baseball cards from the
16:04:04
1880s and specifically the Union Association. So, the Union Association
16:04:09
was like a very early baseball league and there's not a lot of players in
16:04:14
there that actually have cards. And this article talks about like there's no Union Association baseball cards, but
16:04:20
some of the players that played in the Union Association and moved on to different baseball leagues have old
16:04:25
judge cards. And it talks about I believe five different players. So, this is like super niche because first off,
16:04:30
whole judge cards. Not even a lot of baseball card collectors know about it. I'd probably say like anywhere from 1 to
16:04:36
5% of baseball card collectors know about that. And then you're talking about a forgotten essentially baseball
16:04:42
league. Uh most people know American League and National League, but um there has been other leagues as well throughout baseball's history. This is
16:04:49
the Union Association, which I would probably say like 0.1% of baseball fans know, maybe 0.01%. So compile that with
16:04:57
judge of baseball cards. Very few people know this. And I doubt this is something that
16:05:02
our chat models would know right away. So either way, what we're going to do now is upload this over here. I just put
16:05:08
this into a Google Doc. Obviously, you guys will have access to this article and you can do the same. So all we're
16:05:14
going to do now is go to the bottom where it says add files and we're going to upload a file over here and upload
16:05:19
that document. Then we're going to click attach and it's going to be uploaded into this particular vector store. Might
16:05:26
have to wait a second just for this to upload. I notice sometimes I have to refresh. So I'm just going to refresh
16:05:31
really fast and hopefully it is in over here. And you can see once I refreshed it, it is particularly in here. So we're
16:05:37
good to go. All right. So next thing we're going to do is add a chat model or not chat. Yeah, we're going to add in an
16:05:42
agent, but we're going to use a chat trigger. So chat trigger and then we're going to go and add in AI agent. So AI
16:05:50
agent like that. Also, I apologize if you hear the dog barking in the background. Um, so we have our AI agent
16:05:56
over here. We need to make sure we use Open AI. So we're going to go into Open AI like this. And make sure you choose
16:06:02
your correct account model. You're going to have to use a GPT5 model. So I'm going over here using mini. So we're
16:06:09
going to say mini like this. And uh, we have that in here. Great. The
16:06:14
next thing we're going to do is use the responses API which is already turned on. We're going to use a built-in tool. So, click add built-in tool and we're
16:06:21
going to use file search. Now, there's two things that we're going to have to do. We're going to have to use our vector store ID as well as filters. So,
16:06:27
first let me show you how we can set this up. So, first thing you're going to do is go over here and you see how this
16:06:33
says ID. So, make sure to copy that. And this is in our vector store side. So, copy that over here. And then what we're
16:06:41
going to do is put in double quotes. So, make sure double quotes in this bracket that specific ID. Make sure it's 100%
16:06:47
matched to what you have. So, just copy and paste it. Next, we're going to have some filters. So, I already have this
16:06:53
saved off to the side. Uh, if you don't have these filters, it sometimes is a little bit wonky. So, add in filters like this and then type and. So, I just
16:07:00
copy and paste this every time I'm using that specific vector store in AI agent.
16:07:06
So, now we have both of these over here and we should be pretty good. I'm just going to save this. Just going to double
16:07:11
check that our file is correct. Over here we see our file and yeah, we're good to go. So what we're going to do
16:07:17
now is open our chat and we're going to ask a question. So based off this document, I'm going to ask over here,
16:07:24
what is the best union player with a old judge card? So very basic question. What
16:07:31
is the best union association
16:07:36
player with an old judge card? So type that in and we will see what
16:07:42
happens. And again, you can think about this like this is an internal document, something that hasn't seen the web. Obviously, I'm not going to build out an
16:07:47
internal document right now. I'm just going to go and grab something I thought was particularly niche. But, uh, we'll
16:07:53
see what happens on this side of it. And I'm sure at some point Open AI scraped this site, but regardless, I want to
16:08:01
show you that it's literally just searching through the file. And it says, "The best Union associate player who appears in the old judge set is generally judged to be Fred Shershot
16:08:08
Dunlap. He was a crown jewel of the 1884 St. Louis Maroons. led the UA virtually in every offensive category. Like that
16:08:15
is insane. 256 OPS plus and the author calls Hall of Fame worthy as a peak.
16:08:20
Number one provided old judge UA right up. Other strong candidates old judge includes fetcher Jim McCormack who I
16:08:26
don't believe is in the Hall of Fame. Um should be and short stop Jack Glasslock also not in the Hall of Fame. Tommy
16:08:31
McCarthy also notable as the only UA player elected to the Hall of Fame. Bam. I knew that. Um would you like to see
16:08:37
any evaluations for any specific old judge card? So, we essentially went through this document. We grabbed the
16:08:44
most popular players over here and uh yeah, so I'm going to say tell me about
16:08:49
Jack Clemens next. So, her Clemens tell me about again this is going to
16:08:57
look specifically at our document and hopefully it tells us the particular answer. And again, it might take a
16:09:04
little bit to search all this and get the actual answer. And it says, "According to the old judge union notes
16:09:10
that you provided, Jack Clemens was a leading 19th century MLB catcher known as several distinctions." And it tells
16:09:15
you a little bit more over here. I can pull together a full career timeline season by season stats, photos from the document, or check modern databases for
16:09:21
additional context. And I'm going to say check databases for additional
16:09:29
context on Jack Clemens. Now, I don't have even any memory set up over here,
16:09:34
which I should have put on because we're having a conversation. Um, but anyways, we're going back and forth. Now, while
16:09:41
that answer is going over there, I do want to show you that there is a few special options you can choose with your
16:09:47
files when you upload. So, I'm just going to upload the same file again. And what you'll notice, and we have advanced
16:09:53
options over here. So, we're going to actually be talking about chunk size as well as chunk overlap here in this next
16:10:00
section. But by default, you didn't even have to worry about it. You can see OpenAI used 800 and then 400. So, let's
16:10:06
actually use those same settings when we're going to build out a custom pipeline. It seems very intimidating,
16:10:12
but it's honestly not that bad. And here we go. I searched upload files and found
16:10:17
material about this. It just searched over here in the files, but obviously you can add in other tools and things
16:10:23
like that as well uh to search the web and etc. But uh regardless, I I also, by
16:10:28
the way, I didn't even put in anything else over here. I literally just kept this as by default. So I wouldn't recommend you do that in production, but
16:10:35
for a YouTube video just to show you, hey, we can search our files directly with something that we upload into OpenAI. It takes less than 5 minutes to
16:10:43
do so. I think it's pretty cool. So that is our example of Rag Basics with
16:10:48
OpenAI. You don't even have to worry about anything technical. All we had to do is upload a file. But this next
16:10:54
section, I'm going to be showing you how to build out a custom pipeline where we're going to talk about embedding and then we're going to actually ask
16:11:00
questions with it. We're going to be using a vector database called Pine Cone. It is free to use out of the box.
16:11:06
So, you don't have to worry about anything like that. Obviously, you're going to have to set up an API key and stuff like that, which I will show you
16:11:11
how to do and we're going to jump into that right now. All right, let's uh cover more advanced rag this time. What
16:11:18
we're going to do is instead of just uploading a file, we're going to go through and actually build a pipeline
16:11:25
and then ask questions based around it. I'm going to teach you all the different components as well as we build through
16:11:30
it. So, the first thing we're going to do is we're going to grab a file and upload it. So, you should be very
16:11:36
familiar with this, but we're going to do a form. And I don't know why I searching form submission, but it's just
16:11:42
an AN form. And uh what we're going to do is a trigger on new NAM form event.
16:11:47
So, you'll see on new form submission over here. Um we're going to label this over here file uploader.
16:11:55
And we're just going to add a file. So, we're going to say file. And what is the file?
16:12:04
We'll just do file. Cool. And I'm only going to do one upload file at a time. Now, here's the deal. When you upload
16:12:10
files into a vector store, people have pretty complicated pipelines just depending what they are. For example,
16:12:18
let's say you have an if node over here or a switch. So like we'll write an if
16:12:23
or switch based on file type.
16:12:28
See this through like a PDF. So imagine if something was a PDF and you have an
16:12:34
if. So if it's a PDF, you might want to go over here and use OCR
16:12:40
and we'll say OCR to put Mistral not OCR but you'll use
16:12:46
like a Mistl and extract text from that PDF document. Otherwise, you know, your
16:12:53
file should be fine and you can load this into the vector store. I'm just going to be building out the most basic
16:12:59
pipeline for you guys. These can get very complicated and um outside the
16:13:05
scope of today's video. So, what I'm going to do is use a a vector database. Now, what I'm going to use specifically
16:13:11
is Pine Cone. So, if you go to Pine Cone vector store over here, this is what I want to do. And I'm going to say add
16:13:18
documents to a vector store. So you saw how we added documents to OpenAI. We're
16:13:24
just adding documents in this Pine Cone vector sort. There's a ton of different vector databases and out there, but
16:13:30
we're going to use Pyone because it's pretty easy to set up and it's easy. So
16:13:35
this brings me to the first section, which is going to be our embeddings. So
16:13:41
if you click on this over here, you'll see there's a bunch of different embeddings over here. I would just start
16:13:46
with OpenAI embeddings. and you'll see that you already have your OpenAI account and you'll be fine. And then
16:13:53
there's different options. So small is cheaper. It's a little bit less accurate
16:13:58
than large. So I would just recommend using large text embeddings. Um it's a little bit pricier, but I would
16:14:05
recommend using that. And you'll see that we have embeddings. And you might be like, well, what does embeddings do?
16:14:11
Well, essentially what embeddings does is it takes your text. So you can
16:14:16
imagine you have a text like this. And what we're going to do is just have a text called nan. And this is getting
16:14:23
it to set to be some sort of vector. And this sounds very confusing, but a vector
16:14:28
is essentially like this. It's a bunch of numbers over here. And we'll say like.32
16:14:34
or.34. We're just going to use this over here.11. And you get the point. These go on for
16:14:40
quite a while. The size over here tells you how many embeddings that you
16:14:46
specifically have. A large embedding or a small embedding. So, we're going to
16:14:51
want to build this out because essentially words are going to have different meanings and I should say like
16:14:57
chunks, but we're going to use a word example. So, imagine any n has something like this.
16:15:02
Then you might want to use a tool like make and uh we're going to have very
16:15:08
similar embeddings. We'll say like 0.12, 0.3 and 0.1 like this. And you can see
16:15:15
that these are close together because any and make are both automation software. Then if you have something
16:15:21
like Photoshop, well it is a software, it's going to be different. You might have something like
16:15:26
2.7 and then
16:15:31
18. So these are farther apart. And essentially what this does again um you
16:15:38
take your text and you represent them in numbers. That's what our embeddings allows us to do. And um things that are
16:15:45
closer together are going to have similar numbers whereas things that are different are going to be way off. So you can see Photoshop is farther from
16:15:51
any make. Let's say I go over here and I add in a metal band in Metallica. And
16:15:57
Metallica is going to just have completely different things. It's going to be like 08.8.
16:16:03
let's say 08, right? It doesn't matter. And there's a lot more numbers associated with it. But you can see this
16:16:09
is way farther away than Photoshop, which is a software, which is still far away from both NAN and make since
16:16:15
they're very similar software providers. So essentially, that's what embedding is. It's changing our data into specific
16:16:22
vectors. And that is our first part. Large uses 3072
16:16:28
and small I want to say uses what is it 1536. And it's important that you keep this
16:16:35
consistent across the board. So large 3072, small 1536.
16:16:41
So next thing what we're going to do is add in a a document loader.
16:16:47
So you'll see the document there's a star over here. So we need to add that. There's an option and it says default
16:16:52
document loader. So choose that option. And you'll see over here we have our
16:16:58
type of data. So since we're passing in a binary file over here, we need to make
16:17:04
sure that our document loader uses a binary file. So you can see binary, we're going to say load specific data.
16:17:11
And then what I'm going to say is data format. I'm going to choose a document over here. And uh you'll see load docx
16:17:20
over here. So that's what I want to choose. And then we're going to say data. And then you have something called
16:17:25
text splitting. So, this will tell you how you split up text in a document. By
16:17:31
default, it's simple. What you see it says every 1,000 characters with a 200 character overlap. Open AAI, if I
16:17:37
remember correctly, was 800 and 400. I apologize for not knowing this right away, but um I recorded this a little
16:17:42
bit earlier, although you'll see it right after. But you can specify text splitting. Keep it default if you want,
16:17:48
but you can choose a custom option. Now, when you choose a custom option, you'll see that there is something called a
16:17:53
text splitter down below. Our default data loader, let's add in a
16:18:00
text splitter. And there's three options. You have the character text splitter, which is split text into chunks by characters. If you click over
16:18:06
this, you choose a separator. So, you can choose like a period or a new line or however you specifically want it on
16:18:14
your characters. I don't recommend that approach. The other one over here is a token splitter. So this splits literally
16:18:20
by a number of tokens. And if you remember a little bit earlier when we were talking about large language models, one of the ways that they um
16:18:27
specifically count how much usage is by tokens. So tokens isn't exactly by
16:18:33
characters. There's a little bit of difference between them. One I would recommend that you use is the recursive
16:18:38
character text splitter. This takes kind of the bo best of both sides. So it splits text into chunks by characters
16:18:44
recursively. Recommended for most use cases. So, for example, in this one, it'll recursively grab like paragraphs
16:18:50
or specific breaks within your text. So, this is what I would recommend that you
16:18:55
utilize and any end does as well. Then you'll see something that says chunk size and then chunk overlap. So, what
16:19:01
chunk size essentially allows you to see is how many tokens of text are we going to keep together. And then overlap is
16:19:08
going to be how much of the previous chunk is used. So, to show you a very basic example,
16:19:14
let's create two chunks. We're going to start off with a chunk one and then we'll have like a chunk two just to
16:19:20
explain the overlap. So imagine chunk one we say Bill lily strings
16:19:26
is a jam band bluegrass guitarist.
16:19:32
And then chunk two is going to use a little bit of overlap from chunk one and say um jam band bluegrass guitarist.
16:19:40
He has played with
16:19:46
fish and Tommy made three completely different styles
16:19:52
and yeah that's fine over here. So you'll see with an overlap we keep some
16:19:57
of the context of the earlier chunk so that way we have this here in the beginning and then we have our specific
16:20:03
chunk underneath it. So that is a strategy a lot of people use. Obviously there's other strategies um fused with
16:20:08
the data loader outside of Nen but really out of the three options use a recursive character text splitter. So
16:20:16
that is our first part of it and this is like a very basic pipeline. We have to
16:20:22
obviously set up everything in pine cone still because we have not done that as of yet. So we're going to have to choose
16:20:28
our specific things in here. You can see we have pine cone API account. I'll have to show you how to set this up. We're
16:20:34
going to insert documents for operation. Obviously, there's other things as well that you could utilize in over here. I haven't showed you the pine cone index
16:20:40
and I haven't shown you the embedding batch size. So, a few other things that we're going to have to do, but this is
16:20:46
the basics, right? We go over here, we submit through a form submission. We go
16:20:52
and set up a pine cone vector store, which I haven't shown you yet. We're going to use an embeddings model. I just
16:20:57
recommend using embeddings large. A little bit pricier, but a little better. You're going to have some sort of data
16:21:02
loader and then you're going to have a recursive character text splitter. Easiest rag pipeline that you could set
16:21:09
up on the other side of it. And I'll show you this here in a second. How do you utilize what has been built over
16:21:16
here? Well, the first thing that you would want to do is have a chat trigger or however else you want to utilize
16:21:21
this. I'm just going to use a chat trigger because we're going to ask questions about a document. And then what we can hop over here, there's a few
16:21:27
different options. You can use an AI agent as one option. I see this used a lot. Or you can go over here and search
16:21:34
for question. So you can see question and answer chain and you can go over
16:21:39
here and ask about this as well. And this one over here as a model and a retriever. I'm just going to use an AI
16:21:45
agent for this example, but this is another note I would highly recommend because you can go over here and use
16:21:51
vector databases as well with this, but we're going to just focus on our H agent for this one. So, I'm going to close out
16:21:58
of this. Inside our AI agent, what we're going to set up first is our OpenAI chat
16:22:04
or OpenAI model. It could really be whatever model you want. Let's say we use Enthropic this side. So, this
16:22:10
doesn't matter for the model. However, when we go to our Pine Cone vector store, which you'll see over here as a
16:22:16
tool. So, if I go over here and search Pine Cone, you'll see pine cone matches. So, this is our vector store, right?
16:22:22
We're using a pine cone vector store here. vector store over here. And what we have
16:22:28
to still do is create our index and match all this. And that's fine. We'll cover this a little bit later
16:22:34
and uh to set a description. And then after this, you want to use an embeddings model. And it should be the
16:22:41
same exact model that you have over here. So sometimes I'll see people that try to have like both of these are the
16:22:46
same over here. I just recommend you copy this over. And it's super important because if you don't have the correct
16:22:52
embedding model, you are going to have issues. So make sure that these are the same. Whatever you have on your
16:22:58
retrieval component as well as whatever you have when you're embedding your specific documents, you need to use the
16:23:05
same exact embeddings model. You're going to have issues if you do not. So
16:23:11
obviously like this is a very simplistic example over here. All we're doing is chat message into an AI agent. Um we can
16:23:17
use whatever model we want over here. However, your open AI needs to be the same. There's a lot more complexity that
16:23:24
we can do and I'll show you a little bit more, but I want to go into Pineco now. All right. So, we're going to build this
16:23:30
out in Pine Cone now. So, go to pine cone.io. You'll get brought to this page right over here. Make sure you click the
16:23:37
sign up and it's going to essentially have you go through that process. I've already signed up, so I'm not going to
16:23:42
go through that. Really quick, I wanted to show you where you can find your API key. So I'm back over here. Let's
16:23:48
imagine I go back here and you'll see I have two indexes and we'll create an index over here. But the first thing you
16:23:54
have to do is go to your API keys. So you'll see I have API keys over here. Just click plus to make an API key.
16:24:01
Going back into any you'll see it says credentials to connect with with our Pine Cone API. So all you got to do is
16:24:07
paste in your API key over here. Again, I've already set my API key up so I'm
16:24:13
not going to do that. But it's literally two seconds. just go API key once you have your specific account. All right,
16:24:19
so next thing we're going to do is click create index. And what we'll do is
16:24:25
choose an index name. I'm just going to call this old judge since that's what we're going to be taking a look at. And
16:24:31
the next thing is you choosing your embedding model. So as I mentioned, it's important that you set this one to one.
16:24:37
We already defined our embedding model over here. And if you remember, it's uh three large. So just go over here and
16:24:44
search for three large. And this is three small. This is three large. The next thing that's really important is to
16:24:51
change your dimensions. So three large uses 3072 dimensions. You'll see by
16:24:56
default over here we have 1,024. So make sure you choose 3,72.
16:25:02
Nothing else changes over here. Uh we're going to use AWS. And then I'm just using this US East1. It's the closest
16:25:08
region uh over here. and uh deletion protected. I just have this off because
16:25:14
this is just a testing account. So I'm clicking free index
16:25:19
and it might take a second and it says index is initializing. It says no records yet. A record is an object you
16:25:26
can add an index for creating a vector and metadata. So what we're going to do is just click over here and go back into
16:25:32
part two. I'm going to just close out part one because we don't need this here anymore. And what we're going to do is
16:25:38
now configure this. So go into our pine cone index. We need to look for the one that we just created. And you'll see I
16:25:45
have old judge over here. So that's the only thing I had to change. And then over here as well, we're going to choose
16:25:51
old judge. So we'll actually set up this prompt here in a second. But I just want
16:25:57
to set these both up from that side of. So now what I'm going to do is specifically add in our document.
16:26:04
Remember our we have a large document. We're going to chunk it into smaller sizes based off of what we have over
16:26:10
here. So, we have a document loader and then we have our text splitter. Um, I didn't actually set this overlap. So,
16:26:17
I'm going to do 800 and 400. Good thing I double checked. So, we have a chunk size 800. We overlap for 400.
16:26:24
And we're going to execute our workflow. So, I'm going to upload a file and I'm going to just find that same exact file
16:26:30
we already used. So, I'm just going to go to downloads and we're going to use this document over here. So, choose this
16:26:36
file, old judge. Click submit. And uh now what it's going to do is go through
16:26:42
our vector store and go through there. I don't know why it didn't think I submitted the documents. So, I'm
16:26:48
actually going to save this and refresh it. I'm just going to double check. I
16:26:55
don't know why it's saying I didn't submit it. Going to refresh this. Maybe it's already in over
16:27:00
here. If not, I'll just resubmit it again. All right. It looks like it's not in here. So, I'm just going to execute
16:27:06
this workflow. I'm going to choose a document. I'm going to click submit.
16:27:11
All right. And I have a problem over here. So, let's take a look at our issue. So, it says
16:27:19
we have our file. Oh, I know the issue. We're looking for data, but our binary
16:27:24
file is called just file. So, make sure that the top of your binary file is the same.
16:27:30
You can see over here it's called file. over here. It was looking at um data
16:27:36
initially. So, I just made this file. I'm going to rerun this. So, execute. I'm going to grab my old judge and I'm
16:27:42
going to submit it. Okay. Now, you'll see it is loading and it says 17 items.
16:27:48
So, it took our document, the old judge document I showed you a little bit earlier. I turned it into 17 different
16:27:53
chunks. And just to make sure it works, you can go over here and you'll see this has been changed up. So you'll see that
16:28:00
we have the text over here and this is our first one and it says there are no Union Association baseball cards. It
16:28:07
ends off saying I I will do a team breakdown all judge cards versus US UA
16:28:12
alumps and I can't speak today but that's okay. The next one over here Tommy McCarthy is only using association
16:28:19
over here talks a little bit about that. Next one we have is league union association talks a little bit about
16:28:24
that. And then we can see our overlaps over here as well. So, recursive text splitter and I'm going to just control F
16:28:30
just to show you guys. We have this in the paragraph above or the chunk above. There are no Union association baseball
16:28:36
cards. It says over here there are no Union baseball cards like that. So, same exact text and uh then we have that over
16:28:44
here on that side of things. And you can see it's getting split a little bit weird because of new lines, but that's okay. So, we have those chunks. We can
16:28:52
take a look at them directly in this output or we can take a look at it on this side of things. So now what I want
16:28:58
to do is just go over here and uh go into our AI agent and test this out. So
16:29:04
I need to write a description over here really quick and we'll jump through that here in a second. So, all I'm going to
16:29:11
say is a description, and I should be a lot more granular, but I'm going to say work with the Pine Cone data
16:29:19
data for questions about Union Association,
16:29:26
Old Judge Baseball. Great. Awesome. We have that. I'm going to save
16:29:33
and then let's go and ask a question with the chat. So, I'm gonna open up our chat and we're going to ask a question.
16:29:41
I'm gonna say, "What are the most famous
16:29:46
Union Association players with old judge baseball cards?"
16:29:54
So, this AI agent should populate our pine cone vector store. Obviously, I'd want to fill out our system prompt as
16:30:00
well. I'm just going to say you you are a baseball
16:30:06
hard researcher for any questions
16:30:13
about unionization.
16:30:19
Um, old judge cards the pine cone vector store. Again, not
16:30:26
the best prompt. I'll do something a little better, but that's fine. All right, ready? Let's save this and let's
16:30:32
send this out. So now it'll go in our AI agent. It's going to anthropic first. Then it should go into our pine cone
16:30:38
vector store. You can see it went over here. It used our embeddings. Came back over here. It goes back to our anthropic
16:30:45
chat model. Right now chat model is thinking because it has the context of what was searched in this particular
16:30:50
vector store. So it searches the vector store. It finds the chunks that are relevant and it's going to keep sending
16:30:56
it back over here until we get our specific answer. So let's see what ends up happening.
16:31:01
And uh yeah, so you can see based on the research data here, the most famous Union Association players with Oldage
16:31:07
baseball cards, top five and I believe this is just everything from our article with points across the board. You can
16:31:14
see all of them over here and this is correct. Um Tommy McCarthy, Jack Clemens, Jim McCormack, Glascock, and
16:31:21
Fred Shershot Dunlap. We have all of our different data points over here just based off of what was in that particular
16:31:28
article. So most simple version of rag over here um outside of the open AI
16:31:34
where all we had to do is upload a file. You can see it's a little bit of work doing this and you can really start thinking about all the nuances like hey
16:31:40
what's going to happen when we need to update a file like you have to build out things for that. Hey what happens if we
16:31:47
don't have a document like we have to extract out text. Um and there's other things as well that I'm going to show
16:31:53
you really quick. So one of the things I want to show you is a reranker. So this is pretty easy to set up and essentially
16:32:01
what happens in rag is it tries to find the most relevant chunks for you. But what if we want to grab more and rerank
16:32:08
them and get better results? Well, reranker can allow us to do it really really fast. So
16:32:15
over here we can see we only bring four relevant chunks. So you can see chunk
16:32:20
one, chunk two, chunk three, and chunk four. Well, our reancher allows us to grab a lot more. And all we have to do
16:32:28
is go over here and say rerank results. And I'm going to add in the cohhere
16:32:33
reranker. So I just go over here and that's the only one currently available. I believe there is other rerankers out
16:32:39
there, but it says use co ranker to reorder documents after retrieval from a vector store for relevance. So I'm going
16:32:44
to click on that. And there's a few different models. I'm just going to keep rerank 35. And you can choose a top end.
16:32:51
I'm going to choose a top end of five so we get more chunks available. And um we
16:32:58
can just go over there on that side of things. And uh yeah, we'll put over here limit of 20. So this will get well
16:33:06
actually since we don't have 20 doesn't make sense. We'll say it grabs 10 chunks. So this side will grab now 10
16:33:12
chunks instead of four. And then this will grab the top five most relevant ones based off of the user query. So a
16:33:18
little bit different. Uh the last one we did, we only grabbed the four relevant chunks. This one over here is going to
16:33:25
grab 10 relevant chunks here and then the ranker is going to rank them based off of relevancy and give us five since
16:33:32
we defined top end over there. So that is a reranker. Honestly, it's so easy to
16:33:37
throw in over here. I just wanted to show you that really fast as kind of like a little bit more intermediate.
16:33:43
We're going to save that and I can run this question again. So if I open up chat,
16:33:49
I'll ask the same thing. It's a very short article. So, um, we can do that. I'm just going to reset this and then
16:33:55
paste this in. And I'll show you the difference on what happens over here. So, we already saw on this side of things. Well, it's gone now. We only had
16:34:02
four. Um, but this time it's going to expand to 10. And then this one over here will show five. So, I'm going to ask the same question. It's going to go
16:34:09
in over here and grab this specific data.
16:34:17
Okay. So, we have our results over here. And you can see we get the same five players and
16:34:23
it also gives us an important note on this side of things. So our ranking code here we have our results
16:34:30
that side of things and uh we get the top five one two three and four and here
16:34:36
we have the page content and we have all that built in. So I would recommend that
16:34:41
you add a reanker over here. It's probably a little bit additional cost but it's going to improve your accuracy.
16:34:47
And you can see there's 15 items total that were uh sent back over that side of things. Okay. So, one other thing I just
16:34:53
want to quickly bring up on this rag section is you can add in additional
16:34:59
metadata. So, why this is important is like in a vector database you could have multiple departments possibly using this
16:35:06
and there's different types of documents and metadata allows us to really filter down things really easy. So imagine in
16:35:12
my vector database I add articles about baseball cards, football cards, um let's say soccer cards, cricket cards, it
16:35:20
doesn't matter. I can add in metadata over here. So if you go to metadata, I'm
16:35:25
going to add a name. So I can say over here sport and for this document I can say baseball. Now obviously this is
16:35:32
hardcoded in over here and you can make it a lot more dynamic. Um, but I just want to show you that you can label a
16:35:38
specific document and say, "Hey, this document is just focused around baseball. We can also say like era and
16:35:44
well, this is really focused around 1800s." So, it's just adding an additional context to the specific
16:35:51
information that you're adding to your vector database. So, that's what metadata allows you to utilize. In my
16:35:57
metadata video, we talk about how we can do this dynamically. Um, just for use of time, we're not going to do that in over
16:36:03
here. All right. So to kind of just recap everything first, why do we care about rag? Well, rag allows us to
16:36:10
utilize our own custom data with our AI agents and other nodes. Essentially,
16:36:16
when you use large language models, they're not trained on two things. They're not trained on newer data and
16:36:22
they're not trained on your own personal data. Rag solves the answer for the personal data side of things. Now,
16:36:29
there's some simple ways that you could use rag like what I showed you with OpenAI or you can build out advanced
16:36:34
pipelines. This is a very basic pipeline. Like I'm not even saying this is great by any means and I would not
16:36:40
recommend that you use this HIPPA pipeline in production because there's a lot more that you should utilize. This makes assumption we're only using doc x
16:36:47
files and we have clean data and like we're not updating our data. In the real
16:36:52
world, you're going to have scenarios where there's different data types that people want to upload. there's going to be new versions of data that you're
16:36:58
going to have to upload and you have to really control all this pieces of information. A few other key points. So,
16:37:03
when we embed our text, we're taking our text like this and turning it into a vector representation of numbers. When
16:37:10
things are closely related, they're going to have closer vectors. When things are far apart from each other, for example, software and Metallica,
16:37:17
their vectors are going to be farther away within a vector database. You have a lot of different embeddings models out
16:37:23
there. The easiest one to probably use out of the box is going to be OpenAI small or large. Large is going to cost
16:37:29
you a little bit more money, but I would recommend that you utilize that. Um, text splitting wise, I would recommend
16:37:35
that you use the recursive text character text splitter. So, essentially, it recursively breaks apart
16:37:41
your document and this is the best one out in the market, at least in any end. I can see this changing here in the
16:37:47
future, but I would recommend using that. And then you can define the chunk size as well as the overlap. Remember
16:37:53
overlap is from the previous section. When you're going to go and actually query the vector store, uh first thing
16:37:59
you need to make sure that when you set this up, you're using the same embedding model as over here. So make sure those
16:38:06
are one to one. Uh you can also return a different amount of results each time.
16:38:11
This is based off of this limit over here. So number of top results to fetch from the vector store. You can also
16:38:17
increase this based off of a reranker. And a reranker will essentially allow us to grab more results, rank them, and
16:38:23
only send the relevant ones associated with it. This is static right now. And you can see it says top end, but I can
16:38:29
see them making this a little bit more dynamic here in the future. So, since you're with an AI agent, if you add in a
16:38:35
vector store, that allows us to grab the information that we populated a little bit earlier over here. Lastly, when
16:38:40
you're uploading in documents and text, you can add in additional metadata just to give a little bit more context on
16:38:47
what is going on. And you can filter by that metadata as well. So this is again surface level of rag. I'm actually going
16:38:53
to be making a lot more rag videos here on the YouTube channel as well as probably like a rag any end course
16:38:58
that's going to be like four or five hours. It's going to be a lot better presentation than just this rag section.
16:39:04
I'll I'll really dive you through a lot of different examples and things like this. This is just a small part of our nan course and there's so much that we
16:39:11
have to cover. But just know that this tool is available for you and I think it will really help out your workflows when
16:39:17
it necessarily is needed. I'm actually going to give you guys a rag challenge. I'm not going to build it out, but I
16:39:23
want you to build out a solution for it and I'll talk about it right now. All right. So, here is the project I want
16:39:29
you guys to try with the knowledge I just covered. I want you to build out a rag workflow that will help answer
16:39:35
support tickets. What I want you to do is generate some examples of questions that people have and the specific
16:39:41
results that would be asked for those particular questions. Obviously, it's going to take some time building out a
16:39:47
document and how you want to specifically respond back. But this is just one of the most common use cases
16:39:53
for rag out there. And I want to give you guys a little bit of challenge. This is kind of towards the end of the course. You have learned a lot about the
16:39:59
different nodes. You learned a little bit about Rag. Let's see if you could build this one out. And if you want some
16:40:05
feedback as well, feel free to post it in the school community. We've done a lot of walkthroughs together on smaller
16:40:11
projects and workflows, but this is one I want to see you build that out. So, build it out for a specific domain, post
16:40:17
it in our school group, and you'll get some feedback from some of our members. Anyways, the next section is going to be
16:40:24
a little bit different. We're going to be talking about how you can land customers. This was the last technical
16:40:29
NAN video and obviously one of the hardest parts to understand here in the beginning. I'm losing my voice because
16:40:35
we've talked so much throughout this course and I'm a bit tired but we're going to jump into Upwork right now for
16:40:41
freelancing and I will see you right there. All right. So, we've covered most of the N material. There might be like
16:40:47
one or two lectures after this but I wanted to show you guys how you can land customers. I'm going to be using a
16:40:53
platform called Upwork. I think this is probably the easiest way for you to get a customer. It's not easy by any means.
16:41:00
It will take some work. However, uh everyone on Upwork that's posting a job wants to hire someone uh for a specific
16:41:07
task. So, you're getting a very warm lead. Uh I'm going to share my screen and we're going to walk through probably a live proposal or two. And yeah, so
16:41:17
here we are on the website. First, you're gonna have to set up your account and get that going. You know, honestly,
16:41:23
it might take you hour or two hours to set up account. My profile is not even that great. I go over to my profile.
16:41:30
You'll take a look at this. And I'm going to roast my profile on here as we
16:41:35
load this up. So, I have data YouTuber specializing in Nan, Python, and SQL.
16:41:42
That's an okay title. I should put like data and AI.
16:41:48
And we're going to say Oh, my Arley's fine. I needed to change that. data
16:41:55
and AI. Yeah, I like that. It's fine.
16:42:01
That looks a little bit better because these are projects I've taken any projects, Python as well as SQL. You
16:42:08
know, my picture over here does not look that great. I should change that up. It's honestly not that good. Uh, okay.
16:42:17
Then I have essentially a bio data scientist fintech industry.
16:42:23
I probably don't even talk about N. Look at this. I I have 25,000
16:42:28
subscribers. I talk about AI automations. Oh, there we go.
16:42:34
N all caps. When I first learned about an uh portfolio is pretty garbage. You
16:42:40
can see I have this project over here. I have a
16:42:45
YouTube channel and a looker dashboard. That's it. Now, I wouldn't recommend
16:42:51
that. In fact, I'm probably going to go in here and beef up my portfolio because I I don't think it's that great,
16:42:59
but it shows you like if you apply to jobs and you get experience and things
16:43:04
like that, you can get jobs. Like my portfolio on here is terrible. This bio
16:43:09
is terrible. Like, this is okay. A lot of my jobs literally just come from me
16:43:15
writing great proposals and uh just showing value. Also, obviously, this is
16:43:21
not that great either as a profile picture. So, a lot of stuff I can improve on. I have a video over here
16:43:27
that looks okay. And uh yeah, so let's jump into it on there. So, I'm going to
16:43:34
go to find work. And the first thing I'm going to take a look at is N jobs. So I'm just going to
16:43:41
search N. Now people might search for other jobs out there outside of N. Like
16:43:47
it might say a automations or make or Zapier. So you're going to want to look at stuff like that. And this is a senior
16:43:54
NAN automation engineer web hooks payments air table and production systems. So this is interesting.
16:44:02
We're going to probably look at this here in a second. It's one possible. We're going to go
16:44:09
over here and say most recent because you want to apply to new jobs as well. Here is a automation out of Canada. So
16:44:16
I'll load that up over here. Data and technology analyst support development of make.com and an workflows in
16:44:23
monday.com. Now here's the deal. I actually have a monday.com
16:44:28
video. So this actually might be a good one to apply to. Aa automation specialist and chat GPT. This Columbia I
16:44:36
typically only focus jobs that are like US, UK, and Canada based. There's a few other countries as well. Um, senior N.
16:44:44
We already looked at that one. Quick fix needed. $10 budget. That's pretty bad.
16:44:52
Experience N dev traditional development experience.
16:45:01
Don't like this one at all.
16:45:07
Let's see. Email management. These are a little bit older, but I'd still maybe take a look at this. Automation
16:45:13
developer to build YouTube video and food blog generation recipes. That's
16:45:18
interesting. Might actually apply to that one. I do like
16:45:24
some cooking workflow air. It's 20 bucks. It's not worth it. And here's the deal. like
16:45:32
you might want to take on some of these $20 jobs just to get some experience on your profile. It's not always about
16:45:39
getting $100 jobs, $80 jobs, $50 jobs, 20 like start small, get some reviews,
16:45:46
and slowly increase your reach. All right, so we have a few other ones over
16:45:52
here. Estimated budget $30. Yeah, no, thank you.
16:45:58
New we vibe coded a need to implement our vibe code. I don't
16:46:04
want to do that. Text image and video process. This is interesting.
16:46:16
Oh, you know what? I literally built this out essentially. Let's take a look. We're looking for any
16:46:23
especially create the following process for us to have a list of short video ideas on a spreadsheet. Then use an open
16:46:28
source LM model like deepseeker llama. I will create the following. The prompt for the three images a 15-second script
16:46:36
video back into this. So creates the three videos from the
16:46:42
three images. The workflow needs to turn the 15-second script into audio.
16:46:49
So like this is a fine project, but I'm not going to apply to it. So, a
16:46:56
few things over here. Like the budget's $200. This is going to take a lot longer than
16:47:02
a few hours. Like my normal rates like $80, $90 an hour.
16:47:07
And uh yeah, I I think this is way longer than a two-hour job. So, I could
16:47:13
increase the rate if I really wanted to. But you can see like this person kind of
16:47:19
wants cheaper customers or sorry, cheaper freelancers. mentions over here
16:47:24
like $5 for this job. $5 for this job. Has a four-st star review here.
16:47:32
I'm just I'm not going to go after this job on that side of things. I just don't think it'd be a great fit. Next, we see
16:47:40
AI automation developer to build YouTube video and food blog generation system
16:47:45
cooking recipe. So, let's take a look at this. This is might be up more my alley. Looking for experience. AI automation to
16:47:52
divine develop an end to end automated system that generates YouTube videos for a channel focused on creating recipes
16:47:58
for an active YouTube channel with its associated website and social accounts. It's expected to have one long form
16:48:04
YouTube video that produces a recipe post on the website and several short reals to be posted multiple things.
16:48:11
So, is this like an AI video? I was thinking like we're
16:48:17
going to do some type of scripts for a a cooking YouTube channel.
16:48:27
This person doesn't know what they're talking about. They want YouTube monetization or AI workflow. Like that doesn't
16:48:35
No, I'm not doing this job. Like we're
16:48:42
asking five questions over here. gave a freelancer four stars and they're
16:48:50
all kind of over the place on this. Like it's it's not a great fit. So I'm not
16:48:55
going to apply to that job. All right. Data and technology analyst to support development of make and workflows and
16:49:01
monday.com. So let's see what he says. Current a consulting firm and need a junior technology analyst that is wellversed in make and I monday.com to
16:49:09
help deliver a project. Ideally, you have a computer science or computer engineering background. So, you can
16:49:14
quickly learn the project requirements delivered. For this particular role, you'll be reporting to an existing manager on my team and will support the
16:49:20
manager in day-to-day operations. I think this guy wants like a full-time
16:49:26
person for 500 bucks. Again, like this doesn't seem like it's
16:49:33
going to be a great fit. Now I have a background in electrical engineering. So um that's almost
16:49:40
computer engineering. We took a lot of those courses. I took a lot of computer science courses obviously have any experience. I built a
16:49:47
mundday.com workflow but this one probably not one to apply to. All right.
16:49:53
AI automation expert. We're seeking AI automation specialist to design, implement and manage scalable systems
16:50:00
that improve operational efficiency. The roles are responsible end development AIdriven workflows. So this is fine so
16:50:07
far. Deploy complex workflows
16:50:13
audit manual department processes. This is pretty good so far.
16:50:20
Done all that. Internal tooling and this AI implementation.
16:50:26
Yep. Super easy on here.
16:50:35
However, it's only $600. Now, the thing is it's $45 an hour
16:50:41
average rate. So, this isn't too bad. You can see there's 20 to 50 applications.
16:50:48
So, I need someone to upgrade features.
16:50:53
What else do we have over here? Google Ads specialist 10 hours at 50 an
16:50:59
hour, 12 hours at 100 an hour. So this guy will pay
16:51:05
and you can see that was the Martin Shopify audit $300.
16:51:13
So pretty good reviews back and forth. Like we see some eight hours at there
16:51:20
50. So we're going to apply to this job. I like this job over here. Um, let's see if there's any other ones I want to
16:51:26
apply to. I have the other one or two up.
16:51:31
See, looking. That's5 to $15 an hour. Probably not going to be the case. I'm still going to look at his salary he's
16:51:37
paid other people. I I really like that one so far. I
16:51:44
haven't done Voice Agents yet, but I want to cover that in the future. I like Mistral. However, it's in
16:51:52
Lithuania. I don't know if I'm gonna apply for that one.
16:51:58
Good budget, though. Well, let's not discriminate. Well, let's take a look what's over there.
16:52:11
All right. I think we're going to be in a good spot.
16:52:23
All right. So, we're just going to take a look at these other ones. Web hooks, payments, networking
16:52:29
payments. So, 30 to 40 workflows. Look at that.
16:52:51
Look at how many questions you have to answer. All will be ignored. One 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
16:53:03
9 10 11 12. There's literally like 20 questions on
16:53:09
here. that. Oh, well, he already hired someone. It says hires one. So, not even
16:53:16
worth me going through this. I'm not going to say that. I've I've
16:53:22
never seen a job with like 20 questions for an application. I mean, I've had like I feel like a lot
16:53:29
of this could be asked on a call. Like, you don't need to have all 20 here. Not the not the wrist jobs, but All right.
16:53:36
So, we like the $600 one. We're gonna get clarity on that budget.
16:53:43
What's this one over here? Although I have a few N automations that I need help fixing, maintain or
16:53:48
optimizing, make sure they work. One, YouTube automation, other social media postings. It's5 to $15 an hour.
16:53:57
So, we have 31 hours at 25 2025.
16:54:04
This doesn't seem horrible. However, look at this.
16:54:10
I mean, a lot of people have great reviews on this guy, but that one person did not
16:54:27
kind of scare me a little bit.
16:54:32
And this guy is a a pretty good freelancer, too, and has good reviews.
16:54:40
The fact that this is 5 to$15 an hour and there's like no description, I'm probably not going to answer that.
16:54:46
Again, you can take risks. Um, oh, look at this one over here. This guy only has seven hours at $20 an hour.
16:54:53
Mistrol,
16:55:00
it's fine. But there's already 50 plus proposals. Let's just go with this one over here.
16:55:07
And obviously the $600, we can start a conversation with it, but I'm going to go and answer this one. And I know I've
16:55:14
spent a lot of time just talking this through, but I think it's kind of
16:55:19
important to see kind of my mindset on applying to jobs. So, we're going to apply now.
16:55:25
And uh we're just going to say by milestone.
16:55:30
I'm going to say milestone one. We're going to say budget 600. Obviously, this is a conversation we're
16:55:36
going to have with the with the person itself. We just put this as January
16:55:42
31st. They can change the payments,
16:55:47
etc. So, let's grab his thing over here. We'll bring that in
16:55:54
first. Let's find this guy's first name. So, clear direction. Awesome client.
16:56:00
Great client. That might be the name.
16:56:08
Yeah. So, Farzanna and our client Farana. Hopefully, that's how I
16:56:14
pronounce it. But we're going to start this off because we did that research by
16:56:20
Farzanza. So, we're seeking AI implement implement manage scalable systems improve
16:56:26
operational efficiency. This role offers end to end development AI workflows in the seamless integration record business
16:56:33
platforms. So I'm going to say I build
16:56:38
a ton of AI automations at
16:56:45
AI automations. Well, let's think about this here in a second. my full-time job
16:56:54
and I run a N YouTube tube channel over 75 videos
16:57:04
and 100K I'm just brainstorming right now.
16:57:11
100K views. Next, what we want to put in here as
16:57:16
well. Um, so first why I put this over here. It's some sort of proof. Like I'm
16:57:23
gonna talk about my full-time job being a data scientist and doing automations. I'm gonna talk about the YouTube channel
16:57:28
that has 75 videos and and gets over 100k views a month. Gets over I'm going
16:57:34
to write this better obviously, but I'm just trying to think of different things. So design, implement, manage
16:57:40
scalable systems that improve operational efficiency. So that's what they're really caring about. and u
16:57:50
rest APIs. Perfect. Look at that. So,
16:57:56
REST API video.
16:58:02
And what I'm going to do is just go to my YouTube channel and grab those data points. So,
16:58:09
this could be a portfolio project for you. I am just going to grab my REST API
16:58:14
video that is this one over here. Share copy link rest API I'm going to say any N
16:58:22
rest API video. So I'm just trying to think of like every part what I can give
16:58:28
social proof. So she says REST API. What else can we put over here? design
16:58:35
and develop complex AI driven workflows like we'll
16:58:41
maybe I'll use some of this language over there. So what I'll do is like
16:58:47
split this out process audit manual department. I need
16:58:52
to talk about this. I'll put a note like talk about this full-time job. Talk
16:58:58
about this full-time job because I do this at my full-time job uh for automations connect maintain data flow
16:59:05
between CRM. So perfect
16:59:13
project management and communication. So system integration.
16:59:19
So I'll put in like a monday.com video which I have. And then I'll also put in
16:59:25
a HubSpot video. And like I said, you could have workflows that you just link to this type of stuff. I'm just going to
16:59:31
use what I already have. So I'm going to go to monday.com since it's fine. and where Monday is.
16:59:42
So, I'm going to share that
16:59:50
project management project.
16:59:56
And then we're going to get HubSpot. I'm just going to label this as CRM.
17:00:05
It's going to be a little bit later. Let's find HubSpot.
17:00:17
Oh, there's my spot. Get share.
17:00:22
Cool. Hubspot video CRM. Great. So we
17:00:27
have that internal tooling. So build and manage internal dashboards and custom
17:00:33
tools to provide real time that's outside of NE. So like
17:00:38
mentioned this is outside outside of N again stuff I've done my full-time job
17:00:46
prompt engineering new AI use cases again I can talk about full-time job
17:00:52
there and uh documentation
17:00:58
I'll mention to like bring up looms
17:01:03
bring up looms etc. Um and Google doc
17:01:10
and notes. All right. Analytics,
17:01:16
automate systems. It's fine there.
17:01:21
Anything else I'm missing? Process deploy. How much is the boost on this one? Oh, boost is cheap. That's 10
17:01:28
minutes ago. Great. So, let's build this out. All right. So,
17:01:36
build a ton of automations at my full-time job as a data scientist.
17:01:45
Let's see. Data scientist and I run a YouTube.
17:01:53
So, I'll just say that. And I run a nan YouTube channel. Obviously, I should say data
17:02:01
AI slash because this person's really focused on AI, although it's really data. So, you can say AI automation. So,
17:02:08
I'm just going to say AI and YouTube channel. Really, it's data, but that's fine. Build a tunnel automation is my
17:02:13
full-time job as a data scientist and I run a an AI nan YouTube channel with over 75
17:02:22
videos and 100k views a month. I might change this out a little bit. And I run
17:02:27
a IN YouTube channel with over 30,000 subscribers. Yeah, let's use that.
17:02:36
Over 30,000 subscribers. People like subscribers.
17:02:41
Not 30, but thousand subscribers. And what do I have? Like 300 videos.
17:02:48
Almost have 400 videos, I want to say. and almost
17:02:53
400 videos. So, we're starting this off
17:03:00
based on your technical based on
17:03:05
your requirements. Here are a few videos that I posted.
17:03:16
I'm obviously going to reword that a little bit. So, build a ton of automations. is my full-time job as a data scientist and I run a a YouTube
17:03:23
channel with over 3,000 subs and almost 400 videos. Based on your requirements, here are a few videos that I posted.
17:03:31
I don't like how that sounds, but I'm saying based on your requirements, here are a few videos that I posted that fit
17:03:36
the criteria it the criteria of this job,
17:03:43
this job. So, nan rest API.
17:03:51
I'm going to remove that out over here. Monday monday.com project management HubSpot. I'm going to say CRM. Cool.
17:04:00
Cool. Let's put this over here. In terms of process, in terms of process
17:04:08
optimizations, I use N as well as Python and
17:04:16
Streamllet. Python, SQL, and Streamlet.
17:04:23
I'm just going to put Streamlit because that's the technology I'll probably use um for some internal apps.
17:04:32
Yeah. to look for
17:04:37
quick wins. I'm not going to say quick wins, but
17:04:44
where is and I didn't mean to do this full screen. Where is this at? All right. In
17:04:50
terms of process optimizations, I use N as well as Python in Streamllet to look for ways
17:04:56
save hours each week
17:05:02
and eliminate eliminate manual tasks
17:05:09
when necessary. All right. In terms of process
17:05:14
optimizations, I use N. My internal
17:05:20
Company's internal risk and underwriting team
17:05:25
has over 10 plus tools and workflows
17:05:30
that they use on a daily basis
17:05:36
to save over $100 a month.
17:05:43
A little more than 10 tools, but that's fine. Okay, that's fine there.
17:05:50
I talked about internal tools, right? As I said in process, I use N as well as
17:05:57
Python, SQL, and JA to look for ways to save hours. My company's internal my
17:06:02
company's risk and underwriting team has over 10 plus internal tools,
17:06:09
workflows, so that's fine there.
17:06:17
I'm always researching. I apologize for the dog barking. always researching
17:06:23
researching the latest AI news and can help support
17:06:32
your internal teams with new use cases
17:06:39
and prompt engineering techniques.
17:06:45
Then let's talk about the documentation. So we're going to say in terms of documentation in terms of documentation
17:06:56
I always provide looms sticky notes
17:07:03
on nan workflows close
17:07:09
and Google docs explaining
17:07:15
what everything us.
17:07:22
And I'm just going to say I put the $600 as a milestone. I put the $600 as as a milestone
17:07:32
as I would need more information to project
17:07:39
hours on a project. and um
17:07:46
the long-term I'm trying to think of the word the long-term um partnership
17:07:55
to make this a success. Obviously, there's things I think I
17:08:01
could improve on here, but you kind of get the gist. So, I literally just go
17:08:06
through. I first find the name of the person. I give a ton of social proof
17:08:11
like, "Hey, I've done this before. Here's all this information done. I also
17:08:16
have the social proof of the YouTube channel for the videos like I need to build out other platforms as well. Like
17:08:22
if I had a bigger link or a bigger Twitter profile, I'd mention that over here as well. If you have any um
17:08:29
articles, I'd mention this here. Oh, you know what I need to bring up? And I forgot to say this. I built a ton of
17:08:34
automations running. There's my workflows. I also
17:08:40
have a workflow You know what I need to do is say n
17:08:48
workflow published on the official website.
17:08:55
Link my workflow over there
17:09:04
that over cool. So I built a ton of automations
17:09:10
full-time job as data scientist. I run an AI YouTube channel, 30,000 subs, 400 videos based on your requirements. There
17:09:16
are a few videos that I post that fit the criteria of this job, right? REST API Monday HubSpot CRM and workflow
17:09:23
published on the official website. Well, terms of process optimization
17:09:28
talked about that also bring up I know other skills outside of Vinn. I'm always researching latest AI news and help
17:09:34
support your internal teams with new use cases prompt engineering. Um, I'll say I
17:09:39
have taught taught one-on-one calls
17:09:45
with subscribers on my YouTube channel, YouTube channel,
17:09:54
and have hosted hackathons, other companies,
17:10:00
my full-time job AI Just true. Did a two-day hackathon
17:10:08
last year or not last year but this year I guess depends when you watch this video documentation always provide looms
17:10:14
taking notes and cool the 600 milestone. Great. So next thing what we need to do is we need to set our rank. I'm going to
17:10:22
set these 42 connects so that way I am in first place and I'm going to send it over here. Um
17:10:28
all this project will take I'm just going to match what they said which is one to three months. Obviously, I think
17:10:34
this has a pretty good potential to be longer than that. And uh we'll see where
17:10:39
it goes. That is essentially
17:10:46
there. You know, I should have talked about I was just in Canada on vacation. That's okay. We
17:10:53
have this information on there. So hopefully that kind of makes sense
17:11:00
why or kind of my approach on how to apply. Obviously now we're at like 30
17:11:06
minutes in and I'd have been away faster if I didn't talk through it. But you can also look at stuff like go over here to
17:11:12
find work. I save all this so I can just see things that are populating over here. But a automation is another great.
17:11:22
So then I can go over here and say a automation and just search for that.
17:11:28
That'll be another one. So if I go to a automation, see NN chat GPT electronic invoice
17:11:35
Columbia. We already saw that one. Uh we'll do most recent. Go high level
17:11:40
enablement notion expert second brain. Like there's tons of stuff out here. You
17:11:47
don't always have to search for any end. And I find sometimes if you just search for AI, they pay a little bit higher
17:11:53
than NAN at times. So just go through and see what you want. I just showed you that specific NAN1. And hopefully that
17:12:01
was helpful. Hey, you made it to the end of this video and I got to say you're probably less than 1% of the people or
17:12:08
even.1% that start this video. So I just have to give you a major props because
17:12:14
uh you probably watched this video over multiple days. You've hopefully learned a little bit new about any. You took
17:12:20
action and kind of followed this tutorial step by step and you should be
17:12:26
really proud of yourself because this thing was a marathon I'm sure just to watch. It was a marathon in itself
17:12:31
building this out or maybe an ultramarathon because it took hours every single day of recording. I lost my
17:12:37
voice a few times. I got really tired in some of these videos as I'm sure you can probably tell. Um, a few other things,
17:12:43
right? This course was very beginner level focused. If you want to learn more about the nuances and things like that
17:12:48
with NAN or some of the different nodes, I have a lot of individual videos here on the channel based around them. I try
17:12:54
my best to do different examples between what was covered here and in those other videos. For example, I I think when with
17:13:02
my merge video, I did like 40 or 50 minutes just talking about merges, whereas here I had to limit it to only
17:13:08
like 10 or 20 minutes. So, if you want to learn a lot more about a specific node or a topic, I probably have a video
17:13:14
on the channel for you. If not, feel free to request it in our school group or shoot me a message because I do want
17:13:21
to continue to expand out this NE playlist. My goal initially was to have 100 NE videos. I know they keep rolling
17:13:27
out new features, but I do have a backlog of other topics I really want to explore and dive deep into. And I just
17:13:34
obviously couldn't spend two, three hours on a topic uh in this video when there's just so much to cover all
17:13:39
together. I want to end this video as well and give you a few ideas of
17:13:44
workflows that I want to see you try on your own. Feel free to share them in our score group and to get some feedback.
17:13:51
So, I have them over here on the side. The first one I want you to try is to build out some sort of daily learning
17:13:56
system. So maybe you're getting some YouTube videos in from your favorite creators or maybe you're pulling an RSS
17:14:02
feed or you're scraping a website and the goal is to have a summary of like new things that are coming out every
17:14:08
single day or every single week where you can just read through it and you have an understanding. The same principle a lot of different newsletters
17:14:14
use. They'll go after different sources and then turn it into a newsletter at the very end. But I want you to build
17:14:20
out your own personal version of this. Uh the second one is a content repurposing system. So a lot of
17:14:26
creators, they build out content in one platform and they don't repurpose it in other areas. Same with businesses and I
17:14:32
think that's a very underutilized industry. And I think there's a lot of potential for you to do that. So maybe
17:14:38
start with a YouTube video and try to repurpose a YouTube video into a LinkedIn post or take a LinkedIn post and try to build out an image based
17:14:45
around it. I don't know. Feel free to test multiple different ways or multiple opportunities at least on repurposing
17:14:51
content. I think it'll be a fun project. Another one is a competitor monitoring system. So competitors are going to
17:14:58
change their prices. They're going to have new updates on their website. So maybe build out a system where you alert
17:15:03
someone like, "Hey, this competitor made a change. You should know about this." I think that's another thing companies are
17:15:09
willing to pay for and also track. I know and coming from the fintex risk space, we have to monitor our specific
17:15:17
portfolio because if a specific merchant has a product on their website, we could
17:15:22
get fined by the government because there's certain products companies cannot sell. But and also same with the
17:15:29
card brands and sponsor banks. And I don't want to go too much into details, but in different industries, you're
17:15:34
gonna have to monitor specific people or specific companies. And I think that's a really great use case for any and lastly
17:15:42
I want you to get familiar with Rag. I could have probably made a five plus hour video on Rag. And honestly, I'm
17:15:49
thinking about it because there's just so much to cover here. And uh yeah, so
17:15:54
what I want you to do is at least build out one workflow, maybe two or three based around it because it is confusing
17:15:59
at first. You know, everyone wants to have chat bots of some sort. So build out a chatbot, test it out, tweak your
17:16:07
prompts, try a few different vector databases, and kind of get familiar with the process. So learn about, okay, this
17:16:14
is the different chunking strategies. This is why this works versus this. Have fun with it. Anyways, that's the end of
17:16:21
this course. I am personally exhausted. I'm sure you're tired of hearing my voice. I'm still losing it. And thank
17:16:27
you much once again for watching all of this. I'm open to feedback as well. So,
17:16:32
if you think this sucked, make me let me know down below in the description or comment section. Man, I can't even say
17:16:38
it right. You know what? We're going to end it right there before I start rambling on. See you guys in another video and thanks again for watching.
